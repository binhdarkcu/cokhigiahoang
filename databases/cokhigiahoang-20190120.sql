Về mặt developer, WordPress cũng không dậm chân tại chỗ mà luôn có những thay đổi phù hợp với công nghệ mới.</p>\n<p>Taxonomy là một ví dụ thú vị, mà trong thời điểm nó ra đời thì việc định nghĩa một taxonomy bao hàm các term trong đó, có khả năng tuỳ biến cao, thay vì chỉ là tag và category như các platform khác đã là sự khác biệt lớn, một tầm nhìn rất xa.</p>\n<p>Custom post type cho phép bạn đăng nội dung với định dạng bất kỳ chứ không chỉ là một bài blog, bạn có thể đăng thông tin phòng khách sạn, đăng sản phẩm và bán hàng với WooCommerce, bán khoá học với Sensei, hoặc chia sẻ file, quản lý download,&#8230;</p>\n<p>Gần đây nhất là REST API, nó đã mở ra một cách dùng WordPress rất khác, và là đòn bẫy để tạo ra nhiều ứng dụng mới phục vụ tốt cho cả người dùng và developer. Bạn có thể tích hợp WordPress vào mobile application, desktop application, IoT,&#8230; Bạn có thể tách rời phần hiển thị (view) ra riêng với nguồn dữ liệu (database).</p>\n<p>Với tất cả những gì WordPress cung cấp, nó không còn là blog platform đơn thuần mà đã là một CMS hoàn chỉnh để bạn có thể làm bất dứ điều gì với content. Và tương lai sẽ còn nhiều hứa hẹn, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> là một lời hứa như vậy. Trình soạn thảo (editor) mới này không chỉ hứa hẹn đem lại trải nghiệm cho người dùng tốt hơn, mà còn đưa ra cách tiếp cận hiện đại với developer. Đó có thể coi như là một nỗ lực của WordPress để đáp ứng và theo kịp những công nghệ ngày nay như React.</p>\n<p>P/s: Chúng ta vẫn còn nhiều sticker kỉ niệm 15 năm WordPress, rất đẹp.

However, many Wix users soon realize that their options are limited and adding extra features can become quite expensive. </p>\n<p>If you want more features and flexibility without the high costs, then switching to self-hosted WordPress is the best choice. WordPress powers over 32% of all websites on the internet because it&#8217;s extremely powerful. In this article, we will show you how to properly move from Wix to WordPress and grow your website with complete freedom.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Move from Wix to WordPress\"  src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/movewixtowordpress.png\" alt=\"Move from Wix to WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"340\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59686\" /></p>\n<p>After reviewing various different ways to move from Wix to WordPress, we believe the easiest method is by importing your blog posts via RSS.</p>\n<p>In this step by step guide, we will walk you through the process of transferring your Wix website to WordPress. Depending on how many pages you have on your Wix site, the migration can take upto an hour.</p>\n<p>Here are the <strong>steps to migrate from Wix to WordPress</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign up for WordPress web hosting</li>\n<li>Setup your new WordPress site</li>\n<li>Customize your site’s style and appearance</li>\n<li>Import your blog posts via RSS</li>\n<li>Convert your Wix pages to WordPress</li>\n<li>Create your main navigational menu</li>\n<li>Redirect Wix to WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ready to switch from Wix to WordPress? Let’s get started.</p>\n<h4>Step 1: Signup for <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\">WordPress Web Hosting</a></h4>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/start-a-wordpress-blog/\" title=\"How to Start a WordPress Blog\">start a WordPress blog</a>, the first thing you&#8217;ll need is a web hosting account for your website. </p>\n<p>Web hosting is your website&#8217;s home on the internet. This is where all of your files and data is stored. </p>\n<p>You will also need a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/tips-and-tools-to-pick-the-best-domain-for-your-blog/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best Domain Name (8 Tips and Tools)\">domain name</a> (such as www.yoursite.com). This is your website&#8217;s address on the internet.</p>\n<p>When you use Wix, they host your website for you which is also the reason why it&#8217;s quite limited. On the other hand, WordPress is a free software, so you&#8217;ll need a place to install it. That&#8217;s why you need to purchase web hosting and a domain name.</p>\n<p>We highly recommend that you use <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> because they are an official WordPress.org recommended hosting provider. </p>\n<p>They have agreed to give WPBeginner readers <strong>a free domain</strong> and over <strong>60% off discount</strong> on web hosting when you use our special <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/deals/bluehost-coupon/\">Bluehost coupon</a> code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"orangecta\">&rarr; Click here to Claim this Exclusive Bluehost offer &larr;</a></p>\n<p>If you want to look at more options, then we have a list of the <a title=\"How to Choose the Best WordPress Hosting?\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\">best WordPress hosting</a> providers that you can choose from. </p>\n<p>Some other companies that we recommend are <a title=\"SiteGround\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/siteground/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SiteGround</a> and <a title=\"HostGator\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostgator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">HostGator</a>.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll use Bluehost for screenshot and examples.</p>\n<p>If you’ve already registered a domain name with Wix, that’s no problem. When signing up with Bluehost, you can enter your existing domain under the &#8220;I have a domain name&#8221; option.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41170\" title=\"Enter your existing Wix domain name on the right\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bluehost-signup-now.jpg\" alt=\"Enter your existing Wix domain name on the right\" width=\"550\" height=\"318\" /></p>\n<p>Later on in this guide, we’ll walk you through how to transfer your domain when your new WordPress site is ready.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Setup Your New WordPress Site</h4>\n<p>After purchasing your new hosting plan, you’ll need to install and setup WordPress. </p>\n<p>If you signed up with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" data-shortcode=\"true\">Bluehost</a>, then they automatically install WordPress for you, and you can simply login to your WordPress dashboard from your hosting account. </p>\n<p>Upon login, you will see your WordPress admin dashboard: </p>\n<p><img title=\"WordPress admin dashboard\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpdashboard-1.png\" alt=\"WordPress admin dashboard\" width=\"550\" height=\"344\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59584\" /></p>\n<p>All other WordPress hosting companies also offer 1-click WordPress installers from their hosting dashboard. If you need help installing WordPress, then you can refer to our step by step guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/how-to-install-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Install WordPress – Complete WordPress Installation Tutorial\">how to install WordPress</a> for beginners. </p>\n<p>Once you login to WordPress admin area, it&#8217;s a good idea to set your <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/permalinks/\">WordPress permalinks</a>.</p>\n<p>Your permalink settings will determine the address of each blog post. For example, instead of publishing a blog post to:</p>\n<p><code>www.yourblog.com/2017/10/blog-post-title</code></p>\n<p>You can publish it to:</p>\n<p><code>www.yourblog.com/blog-post-title</code>.</p>\n<p>You can change your permalink settings by navigating to <strong>Settings &raquo; Permalinks</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Once you have selected the structure you want, click on the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button at the bottom.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Change WordPress permalinks before importing Wix\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/permalinks.png\" alt=\"Change WordPress permalinks before importing Wix\" width=\"550\" height=\"424\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59585\" /></p>\n<p>For more details about permalinks, you can check out our post on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/seo-friendly-url-structure-for-wordpress/\">SEO-friendly URL structures in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Customize Your Site&#8217;s Design</h4>\n<p>Next, you should customize the appearance of your website. It’s easy to do that using <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/theme/\">WordPress themes</a>. </p>\n<p>WordPress themes are similar to Wix templates, they control the appearance and display of your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>There are thousands of free WordPress themes available for you to use. Some themes are very basic and minimalist, while others will add a lot of new features to your site.</p>\n<p><img title=\"WordPress themes\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpthemes-1.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress themes\" width=\"550\" height=\"349\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59588\" /></p>\n<p>As a WordPress beginner, you may want to start with a simple theme that’s easy to use. We have a list of recommended <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/37-simple-wordpress-themes-you-should-try/\">simple WordPress themes</a> you can take a look at to get started.</p>\n<p>Wondering how to decide on a theme? You can check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/selecting-the-perfect-theme-for-wordpress/\">selecting the perfect WordPress theme</a> for tips and advice.</p>\n<p>Once you have found a theme you like, you can install it by following our guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-install-a-wordpress-theme/\" title=\"Beginners Guide: How to Install a WordPress Theme\">how to install a WordPress theme</a>. </p>\n<p>Remember, you can easily change your theme in the future, so it&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t spend too much time on this step. </p>\n<p>You can even use the default WordPress theme and start with the migration process. Because the most important part is moving all of your content from Wix to WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Step 4: Import Your Wix Blog Posts to WordPress</h4>\n<p>In this step, we’ll transfer your Wix blog posts over to your new WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Wix is a closed platform, and they don&#8217;t provide an easy way for users to migrate their content away from Wix. </p>\n<p>But we can still automate the process by importing your Wix <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/rss-2/\">RSS feed</a>, instead of recreating each blog post manually.</p>\n<p>To get started, you’ll need to download your Wix RSS file.</p>\n<p>You can locate the file by adding <code>/feed.xml</code> to your Wix website URL. </p>\n<p>If you don’t have a custom domain with Wix, then you can find your RSS feed at <code>username.wixsite.com/blogname/feed.xml</code>, where &#8220;username&#8221; is your Wix username and &#8220;blogname&#8221; is the name of your blog.</p>\n<p>If you have a custom domain such as <code>www.yourwixblog.com</code>, then you can find your RSS feed at <code>www.yourwixblog.com/feed.xml</code>.</p>\n<p>After navigating to the proper URL, you should see a page full of code. </p>\n<p>Go ahead and right-click anywhere on the page and click <strong>Save As</strong> to save the file in your computer.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Save Wix RSS feed\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/savrssfeed.jpg\" alt=\"Save Wix RSS feed\" width=\"550\" height=\"265\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59592\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have your RSS file, you can log in to your WordPress dashboard and click on <strong>Tools &raquo; Import</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, click the <strong>Install Now</strong> link under the RSS heading.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Wix to WordPress migration using RSS feed\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/installrssimporter.png\" alt=\"Wix to WordPress migration using RSS feed\" width=\"550\" height=\"255\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59589\" /></p>\n<p>After a few seconds, you’ll see a link at the top of the page to <strong>Run Importer</strong>. Go ahead and click the link.</p>\n<p>Next, you need to click the <strong>Choose File</strong> button and select the feed.xml file that saved to your computer. Once selected, you can click the <strong>Upload file and import</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Click the upload button to transfer Wix to WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/importrss.png\" alt=\"Click the upload button to transfer Wix to WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"181\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59590\" /></p>\n<p>If you have a lot of blog posts to import, then it can take several minutes to import them all. </p>\n<p>When it’s done, you’ll see a confirmation message.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Your Wix blog posts imported to WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rssimportfinished.png\" alt=\"Your Wix blog posts imported to WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"159\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59591\" /></p>\n<p>To check on your blog posts and make sure they were exported from Wix correctly, you can navigate to <strong>Posts &raquo; All Posts</strong> and click <strong>View</strong> underneath each post.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Blog posts imported\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/postsimported.png\" alt=\"Blog posts imported\" width=\"550\" height=\"283\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59595\" /></p>\n<p>At this point, the content of your blog posts has been transferred, but there&#8217;s one problem: any images in your post are still hosted with Wix.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there&#8217;s an easy way to fix this and move your images over to WordPress. </p>\n<p>All you need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-upload-images/\" title=\"Auto Upload Images\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Auto Upload Images</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>Plugins are like apps for WordPress that allow you to add new features.

WordPress will show you a quick edit box with all selected posts. You just need to click on the Update button, and WordPress will update all your posts.</p>\n<p>See our guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-import-external-images-in-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Import External Images in WordPress\">importing external images in WordPress</a> for more detailed instructions. </p>\n<h4>Step 5: Import Your Wix Pages to WordPress</h4>\n<p>After you have imported your blog post, next we&#8217;ll need to transfer your Wix pages over to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Wix doesn’t provide any automated way to do this, so we’ll have to recreate each page in WordPress one by one.</p>\n<p>First, you can navigate to the Wix page you want to transfer to WordPress. Highlight all the content (except for the page title). Then you can right click and click on <strong>Copy</strong>.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Copy Wix pages to WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/copypagecontent.png\" alt=\"Copy Wix pages to WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"301\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59598\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you need to login to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong> to recreate the page. At the top of the page, you can type in the page title.

Type in a name for your menu, and click one of the <strong>Create Menu</strong> buttons.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Creating new navigation menu\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/newmenu.png\" alt=\"Creating new navigation menu\" width=\"550\" height=\"303\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59604\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you can select whichever pages you want to add to your main menu, and click the <strong>Add to Menu</strong> button. When you’ve added all the pages you want, select the menu position. </p>\n<p>Finally, click the blue <strong>Save Menu</strong> button on the right.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Add pages to menu\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/addpagestomenu.png\" alt=\"Add pages to menu\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59606\" /></p>\n<p>Now your menu has been created and is live on your website. </p>\n<h4>Step 7: Redirect Wix to WordPress</h4>\n<p>Your new WordPress site is complete, and you’re ready to let your readers know about your move.</p>\n<p>It’s important to not only announce your move to your readers but to setup proper redirection. </p>\n<p>You want all visitors of your old site to land on exactly the same page on the new site. This will also let search engines know that your old site has moved to a new location.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only redirect users to your new WordPress site if you had a custom domain on Wix. Unfortunately, if you were using a wixsite subdomain, then you cannot redirect users to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>First you need to open a plain text editor like Notepad and paste this code:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nvar hashesarr = { \r\n&quot;#!about-us/c1it7&quot;:\'/about/\',\r\n&quot;#!contact/ce54&quot;:\'/contact/\',\r\n&quot;#!random-article/c1mz&quot;:\'/random-article/\'\r\n };\r\n\r\nfor (var hash in hashesarr) {\r\n    var patt = new RegExp(hash);\r\n    if (window.location.hash.match(patt) !== null) {\r\n        window.location.href = hashesarr[hash];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<p>In this code we have added three example URLs in the following format:</p>\n<p><code>\"#!about-us/c1it7\":\'/about/\',</code></p>\n<p>The first part of the line looks for a string in the URL. This will be the URL your Wix users will be coming from. The second part in the line is the WordPress slug for the same page.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you will have to manually add each URL in this format. Once you are finished, you need to save this file as <code>redirects.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Next, you need to upload this file to your WordPress theme&#8217;s /js/ directory using an <a title=\"How to use FTP to upload files to WordPress for Beginners\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-use-ftp-to-upload-files-to-wordpress-for-beginners/\">FTP client</a>.</p>\n<p>If your theme does not have a /js/ directory, then you need to create one.</p>\n<p>Now you need to edit your theme&#8217;s <a title=\"What is functions.php file in WordPress?\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/functions-php/\">functions.php</a> file and add this code at the bottom of the file:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nfunction wpb_wixjs () { \r\nwp_enqueue_script( \'wixredirect\', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . \'/js/redirects.js\', array(), \'1.0.0\', true);\r\n} \r\nadd_action(\'wp_enqueue_scripts\', \'wpb_wixjs\');\r\n</pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to save your changes.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all, you can now try visiting a URL from your old Wix site to see the redirect in action.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> These redirects will not redirect search engines and are not very SEO friendly.</p>\n<p>Lastly, don’t forget to inform your readers of your new address. You can do this by announcing your move on social media, writing a blog post about it, and sending out a notice to your <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-build-an-email-list-in-wordpress-email-marketing-101/\">email newsletter</a>.</p>\n<h4>Step 8: Add Essential WordPress Plugins</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/plugin/\">WordPress plugins</a> allow you to add more features to your site. Plugins work like Wix apps. There are hundreds of plugins available, free and paid.

At the end of the day, it is your responsibility to keep regular backups of your website.</p>\n<p>If you are not already backing up your <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/\" title=\"Ultimate Guide: How to Make a Website in 2019 – Step by Step Guide (Free)\">WordPress website</a>, then you should pick one of these 7 best WordPress backup plugins and start using it right away.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/updraftplus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.

It is used by more than 2 million websites. </p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UpdraftPlus\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/updraftplus/\" data-shortcode=\"true\">UpdraftPlus</a> allows you to create a complete backup of your WordPress site and store it on the cloud or download to your computer.</p>\n<p>The plugin supports scheduled backups as well as on-demand backups. You also have the option to choose which files you want to backup. </p>\n<p>It can automatically upload your backups to Dropbox, Google Drive, S3, Rackspace, FTP, SFTP, email, and several other cloud storage services (see our step by step guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-backup-restore-your-wordpress-site-with-updraftplus/\">how to backup &amp; restore your WordPress site with UpdraftPlus</a>).</p>\n<p>Besides backing up each WordPress website, UpdraftPlus also allows you to easily restore backups directly from your WordPress admin panel. </p>\n<p>UpdraftPlus also has a premium version with add-ons to migrate or clone websites, database search and replace, multisite support, and several other features. The premium version also gets you access to priority support.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free (UpdraftPremium Personal for $70)</p>\n<p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/updraftplus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">UpdratPlus</a> is the most loved WordPress backup plugin in the market.

While the free version has a lot of features, we recommend upgrading to UpdraftPlus premium to unlock all powerful backup features.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/jetpack/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2. VaultPress (Jetpack Backups)</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/jetpack/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img title=\"VaultPress - Jetpack Backups Plugin\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/vaultpressjetcpackbackups.jpg\" alt=\"VaultPress - Jetpack Backups Plugin\" width=\"550\" height=\"320\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59506\" /></a></p>\n<p>At WPBeginner, <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-wordpress-backup-using-jetpack-formerly-vaultpress/\">we use VaultPress</a> to back up our website. VaultPress was founded by Matt Mullenweg (WordPress co-founder) and his team at Automattic.</p>\n<p>Although it started as an independent plugin, VaultPress is now a part of Automattic’s another product called JetPack. You will need a JetPack subscription plan to use VaultPress. There are multiple pricing plans with different set of features.</p>\n<p>VaultPress plugin offers automated real-time cloud backup solution starting at $3.50 per month. You can easily setup VaultPress backups and restore from backups within few clicks. </p>\n<p>The higher plans of Jetpack also offer security scans and several other powerful features.</p>\n<p>There are a few downsides of using VaultPress. </p>\n<p>First, it is a recurring expense that can add up if you have multiple WordPress sites because you pay per site. </p>\n<p>Second, you will have to subscribe to JetPack, get a WordPress.com account, and install the Jetpack plugin on your site.</p>\n<p>Lastly, backups are stored for only 30-days on the lower plans. If you want an unlimited backup archive, then you would have to pay the $29 per month per website which is significantly more expensive for beginners when compared to other solutions listed here.</p>\n<p>We are still using VaultPress because we got grandfathered in at their older pricing which was a lot more favorable.</p>\n<p>Even at the higher price, VaultPress is completely worth it due to the stellar reputation of Automattic.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> From $39 per year for JetPack Personal plan</p>\n<p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/jetpack/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VaultPress</a> as part of the popular JetPack plugin gives good value for money. If you’re already using JetPack for other features like JetPack CDN for photos, social media promotion, etc, then it’s an easy pick for you.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/backupbuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">3.

Duplicator</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img title=\"Duplicator WordPress plugin\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/duplicator-wordpress-plugin.png\" alt=\"Duplicator WordPress plugin\" width=\"550\" height=\"166\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59023\" /></a></p>\n<p>As the name suggests, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duplicator</a> is a popular WordPress plugin used to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-new-host-or-server-with-no-downtime/\" title=\"How to Move WordPress to a New Host or Server With No Downtime\">migrate WordPress sites</a>.

If your web host creates regular backups, you can use this plugin to create backups to use on staging environment. It’s a great site migration plugin. </p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Each WordPress backup plugin in our list has their pros and cons, but all of them offer complete WordPress file backup as well as full database backup features.</p>\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"VaultPress\" rel=\"nofollow\">VaultPress</a> for two main reasons. It is extremely easy to use, and it offers real-time incremental backups. </p>\n<p>What this means is that instead of backing up all of your files every day or every hour, it only creates a backup of what has been updated literally within minutes of the update. This is ideal for a large website like ours because it allows us to use our server resources efficiently.</p>\n<p>However, if you run a small to medium size website and hate paying monthly fees, then we recommend the popular <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/updraftplus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">UpdraftPlus</a> plugin. It comes with all the powerful features like backup encryption, encrypted backup transport, and tons of cloud storage options.</p>\n<p>Whichever WordPress backup plugin you end up choosing, please do NOT store your backups on the same server as your website.</p>\n<p>By doing that, you are putting all of your eggs in one basket. If your server’s hardware fails or worst you get hacked, then you don’t have a backup which defeats the purpose of setting up regular backups.</p>\n<p>This is why we highly recommend storing your backups on a third-party storage service like Dropbox, Amazon S3, Google Drive, etc.</p>\n<p>That’s all. We hope that this list helped you pick the best WordPress backup plugin for your site.

One of them is the Cover block, which lets you add cover images to your posts and pages. </p>\n<p>This feature has confused some users because it may seem similar to the Featured Image option which has been in WordPress since WordPress 2.9. </p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll explain the differences between cover image vs. featured image in WordPress block editor.  </p>\n<p><img title=\"Cover Image vs Featured Image - WordPress Block Editor\"  src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coverimagevsfeaturedimage.png\" alt=\"Cover Image vs Featured Image - WordPress Block Editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59536\" /></p>\n<h4>What is a Cover Image?</h4>\n<p>A cover image is usually a wide image used as a cover photo for a new section in a blog post or page. It is part of the overall article. You can use a cover image when you’re starting a new section or a new story within your article. </p>\n<p>With the Cover block in WordPress, you can add text and color overlay on your cover image. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Cover block in WordPress block editor\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cover-image-wordpress-block-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Cover block in WordPress block editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59149\" /></p>\n<p>By adding an appropriate color overlay that matches your theme color or content’s mood, you can make your article more engaging. </p>\n<p>Similarly, adding text overlay helps your users easily identify where a new section starts in your article and what&#8217;s it about. </p>\n<p>Traditionally bloggers use heading text to separate sections in a blog post. With cover images, you now have options to separate sections in a more visually appealing way. </p>\n<h4>What is a Featured Image?</h4>\n<p>A featured image (also known as post thumbnail) is the main article image which represents the content. They’re prominently displayed on your website on single posts, blog archive pages, as well as on the homepage of news, magazine, and blog websites. </p>\n<p>Aside from that, featured images are also displayed on social media feeds when an article is shared. </p>\n<p>Featured images are designed carefully to make them look attractive. Such images give users a quick glimpse of your content and prompt them to the entire article. </p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find a meta box in your post edit screen for adding a featured image because almost all WordPress themes support featured images by default. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Featured image in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/featured-image-in-wordpress-block-editor.jpg\" alt=\"Featured image in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59150\" /></p>\n<p>Where and how featured images are displayed is controlled entirely by your WordPress theme.</p>\n<p>For advanced featured image options, you can check these <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/14-best-featured-images-plugin-and-tools-for-wordpress/\">best WordPress featured image plugins</a>.</p>\n<h4>How to Add a Cover Image in WordPress?</h4>\n<p>The new WordPress block editor (Gutenberg) comes with a Cover block to allow you to add a cover image in WordPress. </p>\n<p>First, you need to create a new post or edit an existing one. On the post edit screen, click on the add new block button and then choose Cover block. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Add cover block in WordPress block editor\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-cover-block-gutenberg.jpg\" alt=\"Add cover block in WordPress block editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"490\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59151\" /></p>\n<p>You can find the Cover block inside the Common Blocks tab. </p>\n<p>Upon clicking on the block, you’ll see the Cover block added to your content editor with options to add your new cover image. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Cover block with options to upload image\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cover-block-with-upload-image-option.jpg\" alt=\"Cover block with options to upload image\" width=\"550\" height=\"267\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59152\" /></p>\n<p>You can simply drag and drop an image or video in the block area to upload a new cover image. Alternatively, you can click the Upload button, choose an image in your computer, and open to upload. </p>\n<p>If you want to add an image already uploaded to your media library, you can click the <strong>Media Library</strong> button and select an image from your media gallery. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Upload cover image in WordPress block editor\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upload-cover-image-in-wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"Upload cover image in WordPress block editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"394\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59153\" /></p>\n<p>Once your cover image is added, you can easily customize it by clicking on the cover image. </p>\n<p>This will show you a toolbar with customization options above the image, Write title&#8230; field in the center of the image, and block settings including color overlay in the panel on the right side. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Cover block options\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cover-image-added-to-wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"Cover block options\" width=\"550\" height=\"272\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59154\" /></p>\n<p>Aside from alignment option, the cover image block gives you the two width choices: Wide width and Full width. </p>\n<p>The wide width option makes the image look as wide as your content. The full-width option makes your image cover the whole window screen. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Full width cover image in WordPress block editor\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cover-image-full-width-gutenberg.jpg\" alt=\" Full width cover image in WordPress block editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"272\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59155\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you can add a title for your cover image. When you click on the cover image, you will see the &#8220;Write title&#8230;&#8221; field in the center of your cover image.</p>\n<p>Simply click on that area to add text. You can write your cover image title and format it using the formatting options that appear on top of the text or on top of the cover image.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Add text on your cover image in WordPress block editor\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-text-on-cover-image-gutenberg.jpg\" alt=\"Add text on your cover image in WordPress block editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"349\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59156\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, there are cover block settings on the right side panel. You can enable <strong>Fixed Background</strong> to create a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-add-a-parallax-effect-to-any-wordpress-theme/\">parallax effect</a> for when users scroll down the page. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Fixed background option in cover block in Gutenberg\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cover-block-fixed-background-option.jpg\" alt=\"Fixed background option in cover block in Gutenberg\" width=\"550\" height=\"314\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59157\" /></p>\n<p>Below that, there’re color overlay options. By default, it adds your theme’s color as overlay color with 50% transparency, but you can change the overlay color and also change the opacity by moving the point. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Cover block color overlay options\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cover-image-color-overlay-options.jpg\" alt=\"Cover block color overlay options\" width=\"550\" height=\"314\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59158\" /></p>\n<p>Lastly, you can add CSS code and add more styles to your cover image by clicking the <strong>Advanced</strong> option. </p>\n<p>That’s it! </p>\n<p>You can repeat this step to add multiple cover images in a single article if needed.</p>\n<h4>How to Add a Featured Image in WordPress?</h4>\n<p>The process of adding a featured image is the same as it was before.

They’re great for making your website look attractive and visually interactive. </p>\n<p>Cover images are actually parts of your article.

In this article, we’ll show you the top 7 Bluehost alternatives, so you can choose the best one for your site.</p>\n<h3>Why Bluehost Alternatives?</h3>\n<p>While Bluehost is one of the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/\">leading web hosting providers</a> that we often recommend, here are a few reasons why some of our users want to try out a Bluehost alternative.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No email based support</strong>: In an effort to focus on providing instant support, Bluehost has discontinued email-based support. This can be frustrating when you want to fix advanced issues that may take a bit longer to resolve.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly billing option isn’t available</strong>: When you subscribe to a Bluehost plan, you got to choose at least a 12-month plan.</li>\n<li><strong>No website builder</strong>: Unlike most companies on the cheap hosting vertical, Bluehost doesn’t offer a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-website-builders-for-beginners-compared/\">website builder</a> with any of their plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are you not interested in signing up for a Bluehost hosting plan?

Your Wix subdomain will have a format like this: https://username.wixsite.com/sitename. </p>\n<p>For example, you can see in the screenshot below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/choose-domain-wix.jpg\" alt=\"choose-domain-wix\" width=\"775\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227613\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/choose-domain-wix.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/choose-domain-wix-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/choose-domain-wix-768x495.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to use a custom domain name like mystunningwebsite.com, or isitwp.com, you’ll need to subscribe to a Wix premium plan. </p>\n<p>After you add your website name, click <strong>Publish and Continue</strong>. </p>\n<p>Now your free Wix website will be online. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-site-published.jpg\" alt=\"wix-site-published\" width=\"775\" height=\"466\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227614\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-site-published.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-site-published-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-site-published-768x462.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can now view your site.

But, if you want to use a professional custom domain name, you’ll need to subscribe to one of their premium plans.</p>\n<p>There’re 5 pricing plans for premium users: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-pricing.jpg\" alt=\"wix-pricing\" width=\"775\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227622\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-pricing.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-pricing-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wix-pricing-768x460.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>1. Connect Domain</strong>: The most basic plan is called <strong>Connect Domain</strong> which costs $4.50 per month. With this plan, you can connect a custom domain; however, you’ll need to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-register-a-domain-name/\">register a domain</a> on your own first and later connect it with your Wix site. You should also take a look at our article on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/choose-best-domain-name-registrar/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best Domain Name Registrar in 2019\">best domain name registrars</a> to buy a domain.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Combo</strong>: It costs $8.50 per month. With this plan, and all the plans above it, you’ll get a free domain from Wix. However, if you&#8217;ve got a domain already registered, you’ll have the option to connect to it. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Unlimited</strong>: This plan offers unlimited bandwidth, free domain or connect domain, remove Wix ads, customized favicon, etc. It costs $12.50 per month. </p>\n<p><strong>4. eCommerce</strong>: This plan was especially designed for eCommerce sites. It has all the features in the <strong>Unlimited Plan</strong> plus additional online store features. It costs $16.50 per month. </p>\n<p><strong>5. VIP</strong>: It’s the most advanced Wix premium plan. It costs $24 per month. It has all the features in the <strong>eCommerce</strong> plan plus an additional email campaigns option and priority support. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wix</a> has a massive collection of articles in the help center for almost any query you might have. You can browse through the articles and get your issues solved in no time. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wix-help-center.jpg\" alt=\"wix=-help-center\" width=\"745\" height=\"327\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-220463\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wix-help-center.jpg 745w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wix-help-center-300x132.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" /></p>\n<p>However, Wix doesn’t have any instant support options for its basic users. They offer priority support to only the VIP plan users. </p>\n<h3>Wix vs. WordPress – Which Website Platform You Should Use</h3>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wix</a> gives you an easy way to start a website, you&#8217;ll need to compromise on a number of possibilities that a content management system like WordPress can offer. Here&#8217;re just a few advantages of using WordPress: </p>\n<p><strong>1. Full Control of Your Website and Data</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress allows you to host your website on your own servers; hence, you&#8217;ve full control over your site. Whereas, with Wix, you&#8217;ll have limited control over your site as Wix itself hosts your site. Worst of all, Wix can discontinue their service or suspend your site for any reason at any time.</li>\n<p><strong>2. Boundless Design Possibilities</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress offers you limitless design possibilities with thousands of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-wordpress-themes/\">free and premium WordPress themes</a>. There&#8217;re thousands of free themes at the official WordPress.org theme repository, and several more thousands of premium themes at theme marketplaces and third-party theme company websites. On the other hand, Wix has just around 500 templates.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Good Pricing Options</strong></p>\n<p>To start a Wix site with a custom domain name, you&#8217;ll need to buy their <strong>Combo</strong> plan (at least) or get a new domain and connect with their <strong>Connect Domain</strong> plan that costs $8.50 and $4.50 per month respectively. Whereas you can <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\">start a WordPress website</a> for just $2.75 per month with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a>. </p>\n<p>To learn more, read our <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wix-vs-wordpress/\">full Wix vs. WordPress comparison</a>. </p>\n<h3>Our Verdict on Using Wix for Creating a Free Website</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wix</a> is one of the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-website-builders-for-beginners-compared/\" title=\"10 Best Website Builders for Beginners Compared\">most popular website builders on the market</a> with easy-to-use features that allow you to build a simple website. It enables anyone to build a simple website or blog to showcase content; however, due to a limited number of templates and tools, you may not find exactly what you need to succeed long term. </p>\n<p>It offers a free website plan for beginners which is good for students to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\" title=\"How to Start a Blog (and Make Extra Income on the Side)\">start their own blog</a> for free. You can always use the free plan if you&#8217;re okay with an ugly domain with your username appended with wixsite.com/yoursitename. But, if you have to upgrade your site or need a custom domain, the pricing options aren&#8217;t cheap for low-budget users.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we believe that Wix is a decent website builder platform for creating your first website. But if you wish to establish your own brand or grow your business, a more powerful and more flexible platform like WordPress is the better option. We give Wix 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Gain more subscribers, increase your downloads, or even turn readers into customers!</p>\n<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll show you how to create a content upgrade, step-by-step, with pictures.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s a Content Upgrade?</h3>\n<p>A content upgrade is a lead magnet, also known as optin bribe, you offer within your article to encourage your visitors to subscribe to your list. The content upgrade offer is usually highlighted text inside the content area of your blog. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how a content upgrade looks like&#8230; See the screenshot. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/content-upgrade.png\" alt=\"content upgrade\" width=\"615\" height=\"334\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228070\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/content-upgrade.png 615w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/content-upgrade-300x163.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" /></p>\n<p>When a user clicks on the link, a popup will be triggered, asking the user to subscribe to the email list.</p>\n<p>Did you know that compared to a typical lead generation campaign, content upgrade can <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/how-i-increased-conversions-by-845-with-a-simple-psychology-trick/\" target=\"_blank\">grow your conversions by 865%</a>?  </p>\n<p>There are 3 reasons why a content upgrade outperforms other lead generation forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Reason #1: Targeted Resource</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike typical lead magnet you promote on blog sidebar, a content upgrade offer is catered especially for the readers of that particular post or page. Since it offers a targeted resource, users are more likely to subscribe to that offer. </p>\n<p>For example, if you run a blog about dogs, your &#8220;generic&#8221; freebie you offer on sidebar, might be an eBook on the <em>10 Best Dog Foods for Any Breed</em>. However, if you write a post specifically about potty training a puppy, you could include a content upgrade freebie / optin for a checklist of the <em>5 Steps to Tame the Tinkle</em>. Make sense? Not every reader is going to be interested in potty training a puppy; however, the people who are reading that particular blog post are absolutely going to want that specifically-catered content upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Reason #2: Grabs Attention Easily</strong></p>\n<p>Visitors tend to ignore opt-ins displayed on your blog posts due to banner blindness. Since content upgrade offers are usually placed within an article, they&#8217;re more likely to grab attention of your visitors. </p>\n<p><strong>Reason #3: Zeigarnik Effect </strong></p>\n<p>According to a psychological principle, Zeigarnik effect, people who initiate a process are more likely to finish it. </p>\n<p>In this case, your content upgrade comes in the form of a link. Once your reader clicks that link, an optin popup for your newsletter / free eBook / other offer comes up. Since the reader has already initiated the process by clicking the link, they&#8217;re more likely to obey your call-to-action and do whatever the optin popup tells them to.</p>\n<p>The good news is, it&#8217;s really easy to create a content upgrade for your WordPress website! Let&#8217;s jump in.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a Popup Campaign</h3>\n<p>Since content upgrades are all about amazing popups, you&#8217;ll need the right tool to get started.

Feel free to uncheck these addons as you won’t be needing them if you’re just starting out. You can always purchase them at a later date, if desired.</p>\n<p>Next, enter in your payment information. Finally, check the box agreeing to Bluehost’s Terms of Services, and then click Submit.</p>\n<p>You’re all set! After creating a password for your account, all that’s left to do is wait for an email from Bluehost containing the information on how to log into your control panel (cPanel).

It also makes your website faster. The newest version of WordPress always comes with additional features and it usually fixes any issues from the previous versions.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll get a notification to update your website on the admin dashboard whenever there&#8217;s a new update available. The notification has a link to update to the latest WordPress version. It also sends an email to the site administrator about the newest version release.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewordpress.jpg\" alt=\"Update WordPress\" width=\"775\" height=\"118\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226321\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewordpress.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewordpress-300x46.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewordpress-768x117.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Apart from updating your website from the admin dashboard, you can also manually upgrade WordPress by downloading the latest version from the official WordPress.org website. To do this, you&#8217;ll need to upload the WordPress files on your <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/\" title=\"Top 10 Web Hosting Companies of 2019 (Real Reviews, No B.S)\">web hosting</a> server using an FTP client. If you don&#8217;t have an access to FTP, then you can simply stick to the admin dashboard method.</p>\n<p>That being said, let&#8217;s take a look on how to properly upgrade WordPress, step-by-step.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Make a Full Backup of Your Website</h3>\n<p>Before you begin upgrading WordPress, it&#8217;s important to make a full backup of your website. If your website crashes after the update for any reason, then you&#8217;ll have a backup to restore your site back to normal. The full backup includes your content, images, database, and other useful WordPress files.</p>\n<p>To make a full backup, including your database, you can use a third-party WordPress plugin. There&#8217;re many <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared/\" title=\"9 Best WordPress Backup Plugins Compared (2018)\">WordPress backup plugins</a> on the market. We recommend you use <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-plugins/updraftplus-review/\" title=\"UpdraftPlus Review: Is It the Best WordPress Backup Plugin?\">UpdraftPlus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-plugins/backupbuddy/\" title=\"BackupBuddy Review 2018: Is It the Best Premium Backup Plugin?\">BackupBuddy</a>. These backup plugins will not only help you create the backup, but you can also use them to restore your WordPress website should anything go wrong.</p>\n<p>You can follow our step-by-step guide on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/easily-backup-wordpress-site-step-step/\" title=\"How to Easily Back Up Your WordPress Site (Step by Step)\">how to easily backup your WordPress website</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Update Your WordPress Themes and Plugins</h3>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to update all your themes and plugins. Sometimes the older version of a theme or plugin may not be compatible with the newest WordPress release. In this case, your website may crash or show errors upon updating to the latest WordPress version.</p>\n<p>To update your themes and plugins, you can go to <strong>Dashboard &raquo; Updates</strong> in your WordPress admin area.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatespage.jpg\" alt=\"Updates page on WordPress dashboard\" width=\"775\" height=\"484\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226323\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatespage.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatespage-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatespage-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also update your themes or plugins separately. For themes, you can go to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Themes</strong> and update your themes one-by-one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatethemes.jpg\" alt=\"Update themes\" width=\"775\" height=\"382\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226324\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatethemes.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatethemes-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatethemes-768x379.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Similar to your themes, you can go to the <strong>Plugins &raquo; Installed Plugins</strong> page in your WordPress admin area to update your plugins one-by-one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updateplugins.jpg\" alt=\"Update plugins\" width=\"775\" height=\"355\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226325\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updateplugins.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updateplugins-300x137.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updateplugins-768x352.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>After updating your themes and plugins, you&#8217;re ready to start the process of upgrading WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Step 3 (A): Upgrading WordPress from Admin Dashboard (Easy Way)</h3>\n<p>This is the simple way to update your WordPress website. You can click on the &#8216;Update Now&#8217; link in your admin dashboard. It&#8217;ll show you the WordPress Updates page. Since you already created a complete backup of your WordPress site, you can simply click on the &#8216;Update Now&#8217; button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewpnow.jpg\" alt=\"Update WordPress now\" width=\"775\" height=\"270\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226518\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewpnow.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewpnow-300x105.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/updatewpnow-768x268.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you&#8217;re not the site administrator, then the notification will ask you to inform the admin about the new version release.</p>\n<p>Once the update is done, you&#8217;ll see a welcome page to the new and latest WordPress dashboard. You can visit your website to enjoy the new and latest WordPress version.</p>\n<h3>Step 3 (B): Manually Upgrade WordPress by Uploading Files</h3>\n<p>To manually upgrade WordPress by uploading files on your hosting server, you&#8217;ll need to follow the steps below:</p>\n<p><strong>Download the Latest Version of WordPress</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is to download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WordPress.org Website\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest version of WordPress</a>. The official website will always show the most recent version available. You can click on the &#8216;Download WordPress&#8217; button to get it for free.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/downloadwplatest.jpg\" alt=\"Download the latest WordPress version\" width=\"775\" height=\"410\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226503\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/downloadwplatest.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/downloadwplatest-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/downloadwplatest-768x406.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>A zip file will be downloaded. You can extract the files on a folder to upload them to your server manually. Simply log into an FTP client like FileZilla or SmartFTP with your username and password to connect to your website.</p>\n<p>After that you can upload and overwrite the WordPress core files to upgrade your website to the latest version.</p>\n<p><strong>Upload and Overwrite WordPress Core Files</strong></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to upload all of WordPress&#8217; core files from the folder that you extracted previously to your <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/wordpress/\" title=\"The Best WordPress Hosting Companies of 2019 (Real Reviews, No B.S)\">WordPress hosting</a> server. Once you upload the files, it&#8217;ll open up a window that asks if you want to overwrite files. Simply select the overwrite option and click on the &#8216;OK&#8217; button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uploadfiles.jpg\" alt=\"Upload WordPress files\" width=\"775\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226529\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uploadfiles.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uploadfiles-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/uploadfiles-768x396.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Make sure to skip the &#8216;wp-content&#8217; folder. This folder contains your themes, plugins, uploads, and other useful files. Since you manually updated your themes and plugins, this folder can remain as-is.</p>\n<p>Once all the files are uploaded, you can go ahead and visit your website to see if everything&#8217;s working as it has to be.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Run the Database Upgrade Script (Optional)</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re upgrading from a much older version of WordPress, then there&#8217;s a slight chance you&#8217;ll see a screen like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpressdatabaseupgrade.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress database upgrade\" width=\"775\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-226539\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpressdatabaseupgrade.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpressdatabaseupgrade-300x87.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpressdatabaseupgrade-768x222.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>It happens when you try to access your WordPress admin panel. This looks a lot scarier than it actually is. It&#8217;s a very quick process and your database upgrade will be successful in few minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It may or may not be necessary depending on which versions you&#8217;re updating between.</p>\n<h4>Things You Should Do After Upgrading WordPress</h3>\n<p>If everything&#8217;s working as it should be, then you&#8217;re done with properly upgrading WordPress to the latest version. </p>\n<p>In case, you see an error with your database, you can check our guide on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/fix-error-establishing-database-connection-wordpress-step-step/\" title=\"How to Fix the Error Establishing a Database Connection in WordPress (Step by Step)\">how to fix the error establishing database connection in WordPress</a>.

In minutes, you can create a powerful form for your website without having to know a thing about code using their drag and drop builder. </p>\n<p>Aside from basic contact form, WPForms lets you build highly engaging surveys and polls on your website. Unlike most contact form plugins, WPForms gives you beautiful survey reports with best visualization. This means you can easily analyze your survey results in real-time. And you can export and share individual charts as PDF or JPEG with just 1 click. </p>\n<p>Not only can you see your survey results in a visually stunning way but so can your website users. After they submit a form, you have the option to display real-time results to them too. WPForms also makes it super easy to turn any existing form on your website into a powerful survey or poll with just the click of a button. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey.png\" alt=\"surveymonkey-form-builder-comparison\" width=\"740\" height=\"294\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225807\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-300x119.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a><br />\nSurveyMonkey on the other hand, is a popular online survey tool used to collect opinions from people like your website visitors for instance. </p>\n<p>SurveyMonkey comes with a number of pre-made templates and pre-written survey questions written by experts to help you build a survey for the web, email or social. They offer a partial drag and drop feature so you can customize templates to fit your brand and to rearrange and add different form fields. </p>\n<p>Other features of SurveyMonkey include metrics reporting to analyze the results of your survey and the ability to collect survey responses and credit card payments at the same time.</p>\n<p>Now that you know the basics of each survey tool, let&#8217;s take a look at the specifics of each to find out if WPForms is a good SurveyMonkey alternative. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ease-of-use\">Ease of Use</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a> is one of the most user-friendly form plugins on the market and there&#8217;s no coding involved at all.  </p>\n<p>The simple drag and drop editor makes it easy for beginners to create a powerful form including survey. Even if you&#8217;ve never created a survey for your website before, you&#8217;ll be able to in minutes with this plugin. </p>\n<p>With WPForms, you can use their pre-designed templates for surveys or polls that have all the form fields you need to get started. You can easily add fields such as dropdowns, Likert scales, radio buttons, check boxes, star ratings and more. It&#8217;s also very simple to delete, edit and rearrange the order of fields using the drag and drop functionality. </p>\n<p>WPForms also shows a live preview of what your form will look like as you&#8217;re building it so you don&#8217;t need to keep switching between the editor and preview. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-simple.png\" alt=\"wpforms vs surveymonkey ease of use\" width=\"740\" height=\"357\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225812\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-simple.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-simple-300x145.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-simple-330x160.png 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Plus, since WPForms is a WordPress plugin, users can quickly build a survey right from the WordPress dashboard, which makes the entire process easier. You can also collect the info from your surveys on your own website, instead of having to log in elsewhere like with SurveyMonkey.</p>\n<p>Embedding your finished form or survey onto your website is also very simple with WPForms. In just 2 clicks you can add your form to any page or post of your website. It also comes with a WPForms widget that allows you to display your form in the sidebar, footer, or any other widget areas of a website. </p>\n<p>You can also enable survey reporting with 1 click and WPForms will automatically generate a beautiful-looking report. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-embed-form.png\" alt=\"wpforms embed form on site\" width=\"740\" height=\"348\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225813\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-embed-form.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-embed-form-300x141.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h3>Ease of Use: SurveyMonkey</h3>\n<p>SurveyMonkey is an online form builder that lets you create only 1 type of form: an online survey. </p>\n<p>When creating a survey, you&#8217;re able to choose from a dropdown menu the field format of your choosing like multiple choice, comment box, star rating, and more. If you&#8217;re having trouble thinking of questions there&#8217;s a Question Bank in the panel on the left side to give you some ideas. Once you see a question you like, you can add it to your form with the click of a button. </p>\n<p>The interface of SurveyMonkey isn&#8217;t very user-friendly. At first glance it seems easy to use but it takes several clicks to figure out how to add a question, add a form field, and get it looking the way you want it to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-builder.png\" alt=\"surveymonkey-form-builder\" width=\"740\" height=\"335\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225814\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-builder.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-builder-300x136.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t rearrange questions in your form by dragging and dropping because their drag and drop functionality is only partial. You have to click several buttons to choose the arrangement of your fields which means creating a form will take you much longer compared to WPForms.</p>\n<p>When creating a form with SurveyMonkey, you need to type in a question before you can add any more fields to your form. This means you can&#8217;t design an online form without adding questions which is not helpful for creating contact forms.</p>\n<p>Plus, if you only want to create surveys, there are still more steps involved to do so with SurveyMonkey than there is with WPForms. Since SurveyMonkey is an online form builder, users have to log in to SurveyMonkey to build a survey and then embed it on WordPress, instead of being able to build it right in the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Winner:</strong> WPForms</p>\n<h3 id=\"features\">Features</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a> comes with a wide array of features right out of the box. These features allow you to take your simple surveys and contact forms and turn them into powerful forms for business. </p>\n<p>Like we mentioned earlier, the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/\" target=\"_blank\">Poll/Survey addon from WPForms</a> lets you easily create a poll or survey to add to your WordPress site. The Poll/Survey addon comes with all the features you need to create awesome polls/surveys for your website visitors. </p>\n<p>WPForms boasts a number of awesome survey and poll fields including multiple choice, check boxes, star ratings, Likert scale, Net Promoter Score and more. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-poll.png\" alt=\"wpforms-survey-poll-form\" width=\"740\" height=\"447\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225819\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-poll.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-poll-300x181.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>With WPForms&#8217; smart conditional logic, you can personalize the survey based on the responses from users. You also get interactive survey reports with real-time insights and the ability to display real-time results from polls on your website. </p>\n<p>You can access many other cool features in WPForms to further enhance your surveys, polls or contact forms like the user registration addon. This gives users the ability to sign up and login to your site. You can embed the user registration form in any page, post, or widget-area of your site. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/user-registration-form.png\" alt=\"user registration form\" width=\"740\" height=\"447\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228061\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/user-registration-form.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/user-registration-form-300x181.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>The user registration form is great for <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-ecommerce-plugins-compared/\">eCommerce stores</a>, membership sites, forums, and more. </p>\n<p>You can also create multi-page forms. If you have a really long survey or form that you want users to fill out, with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/create-multi-page-form-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Create a Multi-Page Form in WordPress (Step by Step)\">WPForms multi-page forms</a>, you can split it up into multiple pages. This helps improve the user experience, so instead of endless scrolling, users can go easily from one page to the next, ultimately reducing form abandonment. </p>\n<p>WPForms comes with other awesome features and addons including additional form templates, captcha, geolocation, automatic form confirmations,payment gateways, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/tips-get-email-subscribers/\">email marketing</a> services and more. All of these features make WPForms a powerful form plugin.</p>\n<h3>Features: SurveyMonkey</h3>\n<p>SurveyMonkey offers a number of added features to spruce up your online forms including file upload, A/B testing, the ability to accept payments, quizzes with custom feedback, and more. But compared to WPForms, the feature set that SurveyMonkey offers is limited. </p>\n<p>For instance, SurveyMonkey doesn&#8217;t offer any specialty fields like Captcha, password fields, or WPForms&#8217; GDPR Agreement. Conditional logic questions also have to be on their own separate page, which makes surveys longer than necessary and brings down the user experience. </p>\n<p>While they do offer file upload like we mentioned, the file upload field is limited to the 2 highest priced plans. Same with payment integrations; you can only accept payments with your forms on the 2 highest priced plans. And you can only <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-translation-plugins-compared/\">translate your form into multiple languages</a> if you purchase the highest priced plan. </p>\n<p>The template designs that SurveyMonkey offers are quite basic as well. Plus, branding and customization capabilities are limited. One of the biggest downsides is that all plans except the most expensive one have the SurveyMonkey logo in the footer. You&#8217;re also unable to preview what your survey will look like without typing in an answer to each question. </p>\n<p>In addition to all that, with SurveyMonkey you can only create 1 type of form, an online survey. Whereas WPForms has many more features available for users who want to create a survey or many other types of online forms. </p>\n<p><strong>Winner:</strong>WPForms</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a> offers a wide array of support for its users in a number of different formats. So, no matter how you prefer to find solutions to your issues, WPForms has you covered. </p>\n<p>You can access their support ticket system right from your account and receive assistance from their knowledgeable and friendly support team. The support team is fast and has great ratings from their users. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-support.png\" alt=\"wpforms-support\" width=\"740\" height=\"405\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225836\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-support.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-support-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also read through their extensive documentation that&#8217;s organized into categories like Getting Started, Functionality, Styling, Addons, and more. Finally, you can also refer to the WPForms blog where you&#8217;ll find tutorials and how-to&#8217;s that include screenshots and video to help you any time you run into a problem.</p>\n<h3>Support: SurveyMonkey</h3>\n<p>SurveyMonkey offers 24/7 email customer support, but to get prioritized email support you have to upgrade to a pricier plan. You upgrade your plan if you want to get access to phone support as well. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-support.png\" alt=\"surveymonkey-support\" width=\"740\" height=\"431\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225837\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-support.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-support-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>SurveyMonkey also offers support through the Help section on their website, but that means having to browse through questions and hope you find one that matches your issue. They don&#8217;t offer any blog posts or tutorials for users to follow. </p>\n<p><strong>Winner:</strong>WPForms</p>\n<h3 id=\"price\">Price</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a> has multiple pricing plans which gives you the  opportunity to stay on budget if you&#8217;re just starting out or get access to all the features you need if you&#8217;re an established business. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-price.png\" alt=\"wpforms-pricing\" width=\"742\" height=\"369\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225838\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-price.png 742w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wpforms-price-300x149.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px\" /></p>\n<p>Their Basic plan starts out at $39.50 per year which is a great option for most <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">blogs and personal websites</a>. Plus with the Basic plan, you still get the ability to create and receive unlimited forms, conditional logic, advanced fields, and more. </p>\n<p>They also offer a Plus, Pro, and Elite plan if you need to upgrade at any time to get more robust features like email marketing service integration or payment integration with PayPal or Stripe for example. Whatever the size of your business or your budget, you&#8217;ll find a WPForms price plan to match your needs. </p>\n<h3>Price: SurveyMonkey</h3>\n<p>SurveyMonkey has 3 individual premium pricing plans to choose from and the prices range from $32 per month to $99 per month. When compared to WPForms, you get much less bang for your buck in terms of features with SurveyMonkey.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-pricing.png\" alt=\"surveymonkey-price\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227894\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-pricing.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveymonkey-pricing-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You get an unlimited number of surveys, questions, and responses with each paid plan but most of the best features are only offered with the 2 most expensive plans like payment collection, file upload, advanced logic, and priority support. And with all of the plans except for the most expensive one, you&#8217;ll have to put up with the SurveyMonkey logo in the footer. </p>\n<p>While there&#8217;s a free version for SurveyMonkey, you can collect only 100 responses per survey. So, it gets quite expensive if you want to collect more responses and conduct a survey for a long duration of time. </p>\n<p><strong>Winner:</strong>WPForms</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Who Should Purchase It?

The best domain name registrars for 2019 (Compared)</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"domainreg\">What&#8217;s a Domain Name Registrar?</h3>\n<p>A domain name registrar is a service you can use to register a business name for your online representation. There&#8217;re hundreds of domain providers in the world with different prices and features.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nameboy.jpg\" alt=\"Nameboy\" width=\"775\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227760\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nameboy.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nameboy-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nameboy-768x396.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Normally, you know the business name that you want to register. However, there&#8217;re services like <a href=\"https://www.nameboy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nameboy\">Nameboy</a> who also help users to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/domain-name-generator/\" title=\"Best Free Domain Name Generator\">generate business name ideas and URLs</a>. Moreover, the domain name registrars are accredited by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and they allow these registrars to provide domain names to businesses and individuals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosereg\">How to Choose a Domain Name Registrar</h3>\n<p>Before choosing a domain name registrar, you&#8217;ll need to look into a few basic things, like top level domains (TLDs). The top level domains (.com, .net, .io, .biz, etc) are a part of the domain name system (DNS) and not all the registrars offer all TLDs. Let&#8217;s see an example of the domain structure for better understanding.</p>\n<p><strong>For example:</strong> www.mywebsite.com</p>\n<p>In this domain structure, &#8216;www&#8217; is the protocol, &#8216;mywebsite&#8217; is your business name or second level domain (SLD), and &#8216;.com&#8217; is the top level domain (TLD). You can choose any TLD that you need. Though you&#8217;ll need to check whether your domain registrar is selling it or not.</p>\n<p>Easy, right?</p>\n<p>The domain name search should be simple and intuitive. Sometimes you know what domain name you need to register. But, if you&#8217;re confused about it, then the smart search system should also give suggestions in the search results to help you select your business name.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/searchexamples.jpg\" alt=\"Search examples\" width=\"775\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227795\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/searchexamples.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/searchexamples-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/searchexamples-768x446.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;re many other aspects we&#8217;ll be discussing below to help you choose the best domain name registrar for your domain name. </p>\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">1. Pricing</h3>\n<p>Pricing is the key feature that can aye or nay your decision to purchase a domain name from a specific registrar. The default process with most of the registrars includes searching a domain name, checking for domain availability, and purchasing it.</p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;re a few domain sellers who don&#8217;t keep this process as simple as it sounds. You may find addons, hidden service charges, additional renewal fees, etc. tacked on. It&#8217;s important to know when a domain registrar is not honest with pricing, and if there are any hidden aspects you&#8217;re not seeing.</p>\n<p>Make sure you check the total pricing of a domain name inclusive of all hidden charges before making your purchase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regperiod\">2. Registration Period</h3>\n<p>You can register the domain names for as many years as you want. There&#8217;s no restriction forcing you to buy it for 1 year only. If you choose to purchase a domain name for more than 1 year, then you&#8217;ll save the additional renewal fees that you&#8217;d need to pay every year. However, you&#8217;ll need to renew the domain name before it expires for the continuation of service.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainregperiod.jpg\" alt=\"Domain registration period\" width=\"775\" height=\"322\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227801\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainregperiod.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainregperiod-300x125.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainregperiod-768x319.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>The registration period can be extended anytime during the year or at the time of expiration of your domain. Most domain registrars send emails and notify users about the expiration date. This helps in renewing your domain before expiration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expirationgrace\">3. Expiration Grace Period</h3>\n<p>In case, you forget to renew the domain name in time and it expires, then your domain registrar should wait a month before deleting your domain name from their list. This is called the expiration grace period. Once your domain name is deleted, it&#8217;ll be available to public and you can lose it.</p>\n<p>The expiration grace period is an opportunity for users to renew their domain name after the expiration date. Some of the domain sellers may not offer the expiration grace period and delete your domain right away at the time of expiration. In that case, you&#8217;ll need to be careful and renew the domain name before the expiry date.</p>\n<p>We recommend you choose a domain provider who offers a grace period. That way you&#8217;ll have enough time to renew your domain name. Another easy way is to set your domain name on auto-renewal. It&#8217;ll save you time and give you peace of mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"capitalizing\">4. Capitalizing on Expired Domains</h3>\n<p>This is a common practice among domain registrars. Once your domain expires and isn&#8217;t renewed within the grace time, the registrar puts it up for auction. This auction or capitalization is based on the popularity of the domain name. If your domain name is common, then the registrars ask for a hefty amount on the bid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainauction.jpg\" alt=\"Domain bids\" width=\"775\" height=\"486\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227798\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainauction.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainauction-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainauction-768x482.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>With unique and unwanted domain names, the registrar sticks to an amount more than the actual price to capitalize on the expired domains. If you want to continue with your domain name, then make sure to renew it in time to avoid paying more later on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transfer\">5. Domain Transfer and Fees</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as difficult as it sounds to move your domain from one registrar to another. In the beginning, you might buy domains from any registrar, but you&#8217;ll need a reliable domain seller for long-term business. A domain name is eligible to transfer after 60 days from the date of purchase.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll share the best domain name registrars below in this article, so you can choose smartly. But, before that, you should know about the transferring fees.</p>\n<p>Domain registrars charge a fee to transfer your domain name to other registrars. This transfer fees can come with hidden service charges that you should know before processing it. If you have multiple domain names registered with one seller, then you can also make a deal to save some money on bulk transfers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addonservices\">6. Addon Services</h3>\n<p>Generally the domain name registrars have other products like web hosting, SSL certificates, email services, etc. As long as they don&#8217;t make it mandatory for you to buy the addons with your domain, it&#8217;s absolutely fine. You can remove the checks from the addons and pay for your domain name only.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainaddons.jpg\" alt=\"Domain addons\" width=\"775\" height=\"257\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227799\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainaddons.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainaddons-300x99.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/domainaddons-768x255.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;re a few domain registrars who force you to purchase addon services with your domain name. In that case, you should look for a better provider when registering your domain name and don&#8217;t pay for the services that have little or no value to you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"userexperience\">7. User Experience</h3>\n<p>As shared previously, the domain industry has hundreds of registrars who&#8217;re accredited by ICANN. Each registrar comes with their own services, features, and pricing. You can search for reviews and read what their users have to say about their service.</p>\n<p>User experiences always help in choosing the best domain name registrar. They show the pros and cons of a registrar clearly, so you can decide about a domain provider before purchasing your online business name.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hiddenfees\">8. Hidden fees</h3>\n<p>When starting your business, you may look for a domain registrar that offers low cost domain names and has no hidden fees. However, the hidden fees can affect you at any stage. In the pricing section above, we talked about the confirmation of total pricing with the domain provider. But hidden fees are important to discuss separately too.</p>\n<p>Some of the domain registrars consider it unnecessary to display honest pricing. The best way to discover the hidden fees is by observing the * sign with the domain price. It indicates that the information isn&#8217;t complete.</p>\n<p>You should follow the * sign to see the notice mentioned with it. If you&#8217;re not sure, then talk to a representative of the domain registrar. Sometimes the hidden fees are so much that they can affect your budget extremely badly. Be 100% sure about the pricing before hitting the pay button.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customersupport\">9. Live Chat Support</h3>\n<p>Customer support is common with the web hosting services. Most of the domain registrars prefer email support or ticket-based support. They add FAQs / knowledgebases on their websites to answer the general questions from users. However, there&#8217;re few providers who also offer live chat support for domain purchase.</p>\n<p>Live chat support helps beginners to get solutions quickly. For example, if you need help with the nameservers to place against your domain and you&#8217;re new to the domain registrar dashboard, then you can simply talk to a representative on live chat support to get it done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bestdomainreg\">The Best Domain Name registrars for 2019 Compared</h3>\n<p>We shared how to choose the best domain provider for your domain name.

The <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google News Initiative</a> has contributed $1.2 million towards the development of &#8220;<a href=\"http://newspack.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Newspack</a>&#8221; on top of WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Automattic and Google have joined with other contributing partners from the broader world of journalism for a total of $2.4 million in funding for the first year of the project. These partners include <a href=\"https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Lenfest Institute for Journalism</a> ($400K), ConsenSys, the venture studio behind <a href=\"https://civil.co/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Media</a> ($350K), The <a href=\"http://kf.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a> ($250K), and an additional partner who will join later this month. <a href=\"https://spiritedmedia.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spirited Media</a> and <a href=\"https://fundjournalism.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">News Revenue Hub</a> will also contribute to the creation of the platform.</p>\n<p>Local news organizations are critical for a healthy democratic society, keeping the public informed about things happening close to home. The move to digital news consumption has forced consolidation in the news industry where larger players have come out ahead while smaller publications struggle to stay above water. </p>\n<p>In a report called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Expanding News Desert</a>,&#8221; published in 2018, researchers at the University of North Carolina found that nearly one in five newspapers has disappeared during the past 15 years. Many others have become &#8220;ghost newspapers,&#8221; shells of what they once were &#8211; either absorbed by larger dailies that purchased them or suffering from a severely pared back newsroom that is unable to adequately cover local events.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com has amassed an expert team to address this crisis in local news. The Newspack platform will cater to the technological and editorial needs of smaller newsrooms, with the monetization tools to make their work sustainable. WordPress.com is currently accepting <a href=\"https://newspack.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applications for charter participants</a> and plans to launch in beta near the end of July 2019.</p>\n<h3>Open Source Newspack Platform to Offer an Alternative to Expensive Proprietary CMS&#8217;s</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/1084900673559371776\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">speculated</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1084887261471072257\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">widely</a> about what shape Newspack will take, whether it will be like WordPress.com VIP tailored to publications or something similar to Jetpack with a curated set of tools that could be used by self-hosted sites through SaaS upgrades. According to WordPress.com president Kinsey Wilson, a former executive for NPR and The New York Times who joined Automattic in 2018, the platform may end up being a hybrid of approaches. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s still very early in the process, but I expect elements of both VIP and Jetpack to inform this,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;Newspack will be part of the WordPress.com platform, but we’re going to be working on a highly curated experience tailored to these news organizations, with individualized support available across editorial and business.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The platform will support plugins that solve problems publishers experience at the local level and will also include Gutenberg-specific editorial tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will leverage Gutenberg,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;A few examples of the tools that might be launched with Newspack include email integration for marketing and editorial; programmatic ad integration, analytics, real-time backups, and revenue generating tools for subscriptions and e-commerce. We hope to work closely with partners across the WordPress ecosystem for potential ways to work with services that are beneficial to news organizations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most important distinction of the Newspack platform is that it will be open source. That also puts it directly in competition with proprietary CMS&#8217;s like Arc, Vox Media&#8217;s Chorus CMS, and MediaOS, that are prominent in the news industry right now. Instead of working together, larger media companies have opted to build their own CMS&#8217;s and many of them are also <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/11/is-it-finally-time-for-media-companies-to-adopt-a-common-publishing-platform/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">licensing enterprise versions to publishers or offering them as SaaS solutions</a>.</p>\n<p>I asked Kinsey if Newspack will be something news organizations could self-host or if it will be inextricably tied to WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. WordPress.com is making it open in the sense that publishers will not be tied to using it forever if they want to their information and copy the same setup somewhere else.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not only open source, it will be designed so that at any point in time any individual site or even a commercial competitor could capture an image of the setup and port it to another platform,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;The value we offer is our knowledge of the news industry, our ability to keep pace with new requirements, and our ability to vet various plug-ins and open-source contributions to the project for security and interoperability &#8212; all at an attractive operating cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 per month. In addition, we hope to expose news organizations to a wider community of like-minded developers and to create an on-boarding system that simplifies the setup.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Operating costs on proprietary platforms are much higher than what WordPress.com is planning for Newspack. Arc costs smaller publishers <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/washington-post-building-tech-platform-arc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$10,000 per month in software licensing fees</a> and can cost up to $150,000 monthly for larger publications. Vox media executives <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vox-media-to-begin-licensing-publishing-technology-chorus-1531828800\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that the company &#8220;plans to sell Chorus at different pricing tiers depending on the demands of each customer with fees in the six and seven-figure ranges.&#8221; Small local news publications are often priced out of using a publishing platform like this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart how much of their limited resources these organizations still sink into closed-source or dead-end technology,&#8221; Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/journalism-and-newspack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> introducing Newspack on his blog. &#8220;Open source is clearly the future, and if we do this right Newspack can be the technology choice that lasts with them through the decades, and hopefully our 15 years of growth lends some credibility to our orientation to build things for the long term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s support of Newspack is in line with its history of building with and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/google-launches-opensource-dev-as-an-introduction-to-open-source\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">supporting open source projects</a>. When asked for clarification on Google&#8217;s investment in the project, Kinsey said, &#8220;It is a donation that is intended to support work that otherwise would not likely find commercial support because of the relatively modest means of small digital publishers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s Newspack announcement comes on the heels of the news of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/01/16/when-digital-first-media-gannetts-hostile-suitor-comes-town/2579392002/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital First Media&#8217;s unsolicited $1.36 billion bid for Gannett</a>. The future of local news is tenuous, as larger players in the industry press for more consolidation and cost-cutting journalism. In the same week, Facebook, who has had a hot and cold relationship with publishers, announced the company is investing <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/doing-more-to-support-local-news\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million to support local news</a>.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the dire situation facing many local newsrooms, the largest companies on the web are committing funds to help them find a sustainable business model. WordPress.com&#8217;s Newspack platform, with its affordable, open source alternative to proprietary systems, is positioned to make a strong impact during this seminal time in the evolution of the news industry. </p>\n<p>&#8220;By itself, an open source CMS is not going to help news organizations remain independent,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;However, by helping new, emerging organizations overcome the complexity and cost typically associated with technology deployment and instead allowing them to focus resources on journalism and smart business practices, we think we can help them become more sustainable.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:52:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Matt: My TED Video on the Future of Work\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48932\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/ted-the-future-of-work/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2707:\"<p>I was thrilled to participate in TED’s new video series, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\">The Way We Work</a>, and not surprisingly I made the case that distributed work is <a href=\"https://qz.com/694410/automattic-has-figured-out-the-right-tools-for-remote-working/\">where everything is headed</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>&version;<div class=\"fb-video\"><blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\">Why Working from Home Is Better for Business</a><p>This company is so dedicated to remote working that they literally don&#039;t have an office.

What I really love about this video in particular is that we get into the specifics of <em>how</em> a company can start to embrace a culture of letting employees work from anywhere, even if it started out as a traditional office with everyone in the same place. Automattic never started that way, so even as we’ve scaled up to more than <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">840 people</a> in 68 countries, there’s never been a question — it’s now built in to our entire culture.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For distributed work to scale up, it’s going to require more CEOs, workers, and managers to test the waters. Any company can experiment with distributed work — just pick a day or two of the week in which everyone works from home, I suggest Tuesdays and Thursdays, then build the tools and systems to support it. Yes, that may require some shuffling of meetings, or more written documentation versus verbal real-time discussion. But I think companies will be surprised how quickly it will “just work.” <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the companies don’t experiment, workers may force them to do it anyway: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don\'t think tech folks quite understand how pervasive remote work has become.

Previously, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">plugin</a> allowed users to display a grid of products by category. The new version introduces a Featured Product Block with design options for customizing nearly everything about the display, including color overlay, price and description, text alignment, call-to-action button, and the product photo. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.3.0 also introduces a Hand-Picked Products block that displays a grid of manual selections that can be ordered in different ways. Other new blocks include the following, which display as a grid and can be filtered by category:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Best Selling Products block</li><li>Top Rated Products block</li><li>Newest Products block</li><li>On Sale Products block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce Blocks is also now a <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/what-is-a-woocommerce-feature-plugin/\">feature plugin</a>, which means that after it is more polished and tested, the plugin can be considered for merge into WooCommerce core. WooCommerce Blocks 1.4 is expected the last week in January with improvements to the Featured Product block and a new Products by Attribute block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2018, WooCommerce <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/people-behind-stores/\">published usage data</a> that indicates 40% of users who could be considered &#8220;established business owners&#8221; also have a brick-and-mortar location, and 27% host events in physical locations. This means that many WooCommerce store owners have multiple channels for selling their products. The data also showed that large stores don&#8217;t always turn to big companies to handle their website development needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on that usage data, blocks have the potential to greatly improve the site management experience for many WooCommerce store owners who want to market to different audiences beyond their physical stores. Blocks enable them to easily swap out featured products and customize promotions on products that are selling well in their stores. All of these actions are quick to configure inside the new editor with a live preview.

ThemeBeans founder <a href=\"https://richtabor.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rich Tabor</a> and plugin developer <a href=\"https://phpbits.net\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Carandang</a> partnered together on this iteration of CoBlocks to bring users new Row and Columns blocks and a Typography Control Panel.</p>\n<p>The Row and Column blocks are resizable and can be dragged to new positions. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-5.33.39-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After selecting the Row block, users can choose the number of columns and then a layout for the row.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-5.40.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These row layouts can also be adjusted from inside the row toolbar or inspector sidebar panel, which includes responsive media query controls. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-5.53.18-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>The Row and Column blocks also come with fine-grained controls for adjusting background and text color, width, margin, and padding. </p>\n<p>Version 1.6 also includes a new Typography Control Panel with support for Google fonts. Users can customize the fonts with built-in controls for line-height, letter-spacing, font-weight, and text-transform properties. It also supports customizing fonts for the core heading, paragraph, and button blocks. </p>\n<p>The video below shows a quick demo of column layouts and nested row blocks in action, as well as a few other blocks in the collection. Tabor said the team has more blocks in development that are geared towards full page layout and design. They are also working on a more advanced Google Maps block, feature blocks, and image cards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussing a &#8220;section&#8221; block</a> since February 2018, where columns blocks could be placed inside the more generic section container. It&#8217;s on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13113\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap for Phase 2</a> but contributors are taking their time to carefully define how this block will work. In the meantime, plugin developers have created their own versions of sections.</p>\n<p>CoBlocks is currently setting the bar for Gutenberg-powered layouts. When WordPress core gets deeper into site building, this plugin&#8217;s user-friendly approach to rows and columns should provide some inspiration for creating an intuitive page building experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 01:49:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress Support Forums Add @mentions with Auto-complete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86721\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-support-forums-add-mentions-with-auto-complete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1852:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Support forums</a> have been updated to include Twitter/GitHub style <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2488\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">auto-completion for usernames</a>.

This initial version of @mention auto-complete for the support forums works in a similar way in that it completes a partial search query from a known set of usernames. In this case it only includes thread participants. In order to make the auto-complete scale for WordPress.org&#8217;s 10+ million registered users, it does not perform site-wide username lookups or include moderators, plugin reps, or theme reps who have not yet commented on the thread.</p>\n<p>The @mentions have been implemented across all WordPress.org forums. Any issues with the feature can be reported on trac by re-opening the original <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2488\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> or creating a new one.

More than $10,000 has come in through WPCamps&#8217; crowdfunding campaign. Shortly before WordCamp US 2018, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interview-with-rachel-cherry-automattic-pledges-to-fund-wpcampus-accessibility-audit-of-gutenberg\">Automattic pledged to fund the remainder</a> of the audit. The final cost for the chosen vendor is $31,200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diverse committee of WordPress, accessibility, and higher education professionals evaluated seven proposals before selecting Tenon LLC. The company&#8217;s Tenon API delivers advanced reporting that assists clients in understanding which issues to prioritize first in the process of building more accessible experiences. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/access-monitor-plugin-tests-wordpress-sites-for-accessibility-compliance\">Access Monitor plugin</a> for WordPress is an example of a tool built using this API. Site administrators can use it to identify and tackle accessibility issues with the help of automated testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCampus will leave its crowdfunding campaign open until Friday, February 8 to allow more community participation. The organization plans to deliver a progress update on Thursday, January 31, and is aiming to complete the audit by late February.

It was a labor of love for so many and the next chapters are going to be even more exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the last year was growing closer to my friends and loved ones —&nbsp;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s externally perceptible but my heart feels a lot more open. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found a good balance with meditation, work, sleep, fasting, eating, and reading that gives me a lot of joy, energy, and feels like a combination I could sustain the rest of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading in particular was a highlight as I finished 38 books, which is the most in a year since I started tracking, and so many of them were truly excellent I&#8217;m going to do another post just on books. I will give a special call out to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TBKYK60/\">The Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu</a>. Leaving my Kindle Oasis at an airport ended up being a blessing in disguise as I started using the Kindle app on my iPhone a lot more and that&#8217;s become my new favorite habit. (And the physical Kindle was returned!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a strong travel year, covering 126 cities, 20 countries, and 377k miles. I especially enjoyed visits to Tulum, Iceland, Bodrum, Tonga, Kauai, Lanai, and Courchevel. I finally checked off my bucket list item to become scuba certified and had an amazing opportunity to swim with humpback whales.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ma.tt/files/2019/01/Tonga-Wanderings-2-of-5-1024x635.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48914\" />I was a few feet from <a href=\"https://www.comewander.com/\">Adam Gazzaley when he took this photo</a>.\n\n\n\n<p>I also had lots of opportunities to practice patience, weathered a torrent of personally-directed criticism across every medium, and had a few months that were the hardest I&#8217;ve worked in my career. With the benefit of a little distance, though, those things don&#8217;t loom as large. I learned a ton —&nbsp;often the hard way but often that&#8217;s what it takes —&nbsp;and discovered I had some additional gears that can kick in when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I pass solidly into my mid-thirties, I don&#8217;t have any drastic shifts on the horizon but I am looking forward to continuing to strengthen the habits I&#8217;ve been able to develop this past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other years: <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/bday/\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2004/01/so-im-20/\">20</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2005/01/hot-barely-legal-matt/\">21</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2006/01/matt-22/\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2007/01/twenty-three/\">23</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2008/01/twenty-four/\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2009/01/twenty-five/\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2010/01/twenty-six/\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2011/01/twenty-seven/\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2012/01/twenty-eight/\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2013/01/twenty-nine/\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/matt-3-0/\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/\">31</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/thirty-two/\">32</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/01/thirty-three/\">33</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/01/thirty-four/\">34</a>, 35.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:12:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 342 – GitHub, Commercials, and Governance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=86783&preview=true&preview_id=86783\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-342-github-commercials-and-governance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2012:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss what&#8217;s new in WordPress 5.0.3.

The automatic background update has gone out and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">23.2% of sites are currently running on 5.0+,</a> with 47.2% hanging back at 4.9. Meanwhile, work on WordPress 5.1 charges forward and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\">Beta 1</a> is now available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">projects Matt Mullenweg identified for 2019</a> was to merge the Site Health Check plugin into core to assist with debugging and encourage &#8220;good software hygiene.&#8221; The Site Health Check project, formerly called &#8220;ServeHappy,&#8221; began with the goal of helping users get their sites running on supported versions of PHP but has evolved to include other aspects of site maintenance and debugging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 brings one of the most exciting aspects of the Site Health Check project into core. It introduces a new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">white screen of death (WSOD) protection feature</a> that catches fatal errors so that users can still log into the admin to attempt to resolve the issue. In the past, non-technical users would have to contact their hosting companies or FTP into their files to try to fix plugin or theme compatibility issues by turning things off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for WordPress&#8217; highly anticipated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">minimum PHP version increase</a>, 5.1 will display a warning and help users upgrade their version of PHP. The minimum will be bumped to 5.6 in April and, depending on feedback, will be bumped again to 7.0 in December 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This project benefits not just WordPress users, but also the surrounding PHP ecosystem as a whole,&#8221; Jenny Wong said in the <a href=\"https://jwong.co.uk/blog/2019/01/10/how-wordpress-is-dropping-php-end-of-life-versions/\">notes</a> she published from the Site Health Check Project review at WCUS 2018. &#8220;Our hope is that this will prompt a lot of PHP updates across the web.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take advantage of more features from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/\">Site Health Check plugin</a>, you can install it from WordPress.org and visit the Dashboard > Health Check for a detailed overview of your site. It also has a very handy troubleshooting mode that enables a vanilla WordPress session, where all plugins are disabled, and a default theme is used, but only for your user. This works without disrupting the way the site displays to visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 also introduces some updates for developers, including the ability to replace the cron system with a custom cron handler, set a custom location for WP_DEBUG_LOG, a new <code>wp_blogmeta</code> table, and a few other changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is currently slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>. The upcoming release is a big step on WordPress&#8217; journey to becoming even more user-friendly. The idea that users will never again be locked out of their sites due to a WSOD is a major enhancement that will greatly improve the way they interact with WordPress&#8217; plugin system. It also makes the prospect of installing new themes and plugins less daunting for non-technical users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 21:17:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6540\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4140:\"<p>WordPress 5.1 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem. The first phase of this project is included in WordPress 5.1. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>). Before, you’d have to FTP in to your files or get in touch with your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in April 2019, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">WordPress&#8217; will increase its minimum supported PHP version to 5.6</a>. To help you check if you&#8217;re prepared for this change, WordPress 5.1 will show you a warning and help you upgrade your version of PHP, if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Cron system can now be more easily replaced with a custom cron handler (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32656\">#32656</a>).</li><li>When starting cron under PHP-FPM, the connection will return a response immediately, even for long running cron jobs (<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/09/cron-improvements-with-php-fpm-in-wordpress-5-1/\">dev note</a>).</li><li><code>WP_DEBUG_LOG</code> can be set to a custom log location (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18391\">#18391</a>).</li><li>Introduced the <code>wp_blogmeta</code> table (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37923\">#37923</a>).</li><li>Added <code>LIKE</code> support to <code>meta_key</code> comparisons in <code>WP_Meta_Query</code> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42409\">#42409</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.1&group=resolution&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=version&order=priority\">over 360 tickets closed</a> in WordPress 5.1, with numerous small bug fixes and improvements to help smooth your WordPress experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for more developer notes (which are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1+dev-notes/\">assigned</a> the <code>dev-notes</code> tag) in the coming weeks detailing other changes in 5.1 that you should be aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>If you think you’ve found a bug</em></strong><em>, you can post to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\"><em>Alpha/Beta area</em></a><em>&nbsp;in the support forums.

Subscriptions, Related Posts, and Tiled Galleries are now available as blocks under Jetpack in the block inserter tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />New blocks in Jetpack: Related Posts, Subscription Form, and Tiled Galleries\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting thing for both Related Posts and the Subscription form is that they can now be placed anywhere within post or page content with a live preview. Previously these modules were limited to wherever the theme placed them, or widgetized areas in the case of the Subscription form. Below is an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-subscriptions\"><div class=\"jetpack_subscription_widget\">			<form action=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\" method=\"post\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\" id=\"subscribe-blog-488\">\n				<p>Join 42,930 other subscribers</p>\n					<p id=\"subscribe-email\">\n						<label id=\"jetpack-subscribe-label\" for=\"subscribe-field-488\">\n							Email Address						</label>\n						<input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" class=\"required\" value=\"\" id=\"subscribe-field-488\" />\n					</p>\n\n					<p id=\"subscribe-submit\">\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"subscribe\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"source\" value=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sub-type\" value=\"widget\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"redirect_fragment\" value=\"488\" />\n												<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"jetpack_subscriptions_widget\" />\n					</p>\n							</form>\n\n			\n		\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiled galleries can now easily be inserted, manipulated, and previewed in the new editor with all of the same features they had before. Styles and link settings for the galleries can be found in the block sidebar, but they are somewhat limited when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-gallery-plugin-offers-a-suite-of-photo-gallery-blocks-for-gutenberg\">compared to other plugins like Block Gallery</a>. Now that the Jetpack team has the basic block in place, they can easily update it with new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will need to have their Jetpack accounts connected to WordPress.com to access any of these new blocks, but they will all work on the Free plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been missing Jetpack shortlinks since Gutenberg was released, you will be pleased to find that Jetpack 6.9 brings them back under a new Jetpack icon at the top right of the block editor.

Layers co-founders David and Marc Perel identified Gutenberg as the main reason for the sale in their farewell <a href=\"https://www.layerswp.com/2019/01/elementor-acquires-layers-wp/\">announcement</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With the arrival of Gutenberg we realized that a big change was required for Layers to keep pace. A massive investment of time and money was needed so we had to assess the best way forward. Having spent all of our 20&#8217;s working 18 hour days to build beautiful WordPress products we reached a point where we felt it best to partner with another company to try take Layers to the next level.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor is the leading WordPress page builder, with more than a million active installations. CMO Ben Pines said they estimate that number to be closer to 2 million, based on the daily install rate. The company has grown from 6 employees to 55 since it launched in June 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor was well-prepared for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in 5.0. While other page builders are still considering how to move forward with the new editor, Elementor released its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-builder/\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg</a> plugin in October 2018, making it possible for users to insert any Elementor template into Gutenberg with one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Layers didn&#8217;t meet the requirements for being listed in the WordPress.org themes directory, because the team decided not to follow best practices for keeping plugin and theme functionality separate. In 2016, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/layers-ends-exclusive-arrangement-with-envato-launches-new-marketplace\">Perel said they were opting to maintain Layers as a hybrid product</a>, a theme that included plugin-like functionality, in order to keep third-party conflicts to a minimum, which he said also lessened their support burden. This prevented the product from receiving greater exposure on WordPress.org. As larger page builders began to dominate the market, Layers failed to gain the traction it needed to compete. Add Gutenberg to the mix and Layers&#8217; founders were in need of an exit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We feel that this acquisition has come just at the right moment when WordPress itself is going through a huge amount of change,&#8221; Perel said. &#8220;With the release of Gutenberg and the new built-in post editor we realized that much of Layers would need to change in order to keep pace with the new look of WordPress and feel that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://layerswp.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5b9a020fcf797987098cc7bca&id=c493b36eaa&e=4441ba6d29\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor</a> is the best company to respond to the shifting tide of the industry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Layers&#8217; Theme Collection Is Now Free and Fully Compatible with Elementor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor has released all 11 of <a href=\"https://www.layerswp.com/product-category/themes/\">Layers&#8217; themes</a> for free and Ben Pines said they are considering listing them on WordPress.org to make it easier for users to find them and stay updated. All of the themes have been updated to be fully compatible with both Gutenberg and Elementor. Existing Layers&#8217; customers will receive two months of support before support is handed over to the Layers user community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Updating themes for compatibility is no easy matter, and we get thousands of requests asking for a theme that is compatible with Elementor,&#8221; Pines said. Finding a theme that is fully compatible with the page builder can be challenging. Pines said users often decide to use Elementor first and then look for a theme. There&#8217;s even a Facebook group called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/126645814685793/?ref=br_rs\">Elementor + Which Theme?</a> with more than 2,400 members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Themes still pose an issue for users,&#8221; Elementor&#8217;s head of business development, Zvi Shapira, said. &#8220;We saw value in continuing the Layers project, and not leaving thousands of Layers users without a home. Layers is a well worthy project, and offering a theme that is compatible with Elementor and Gutenberg for free for our users and for all WordPress users has great value.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pines identified Layers&#8217; advanced Customizer panel as one of its chief selling points. Along with the acquisition, all of the Layers Pro features, such as resizing the logo, customizing buttons, and styling menus, are now rolled into the free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is forcing some consolidation among page builders, as smaller operations struggle to keep pace with the technical updates required. Gutenberg is expected to standardize a way of layout building further along in the site customization phase. Pines said his team isn&#8217;t worried about how that will impact Elementor, even if core ends up overlapping with some of the solutions they offer in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know if there will be an impact and of what sort,&#8221; Pines said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the blocks we developed for Gutenberg. We adapted to provide our users with the maximum flexibility.&#8221; The plugin ensures that users don&#8217;t have to choose between using Gutenberg and the page builder. Acquiring Layers&#8217; theme collection means Elementor users no longer have to look so hard to find a compatible theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our hope is that Layers themes will help less tech-savvy users manage the entire site design hassle-free,&#8221; Pines said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:29:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0.3 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6530\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-0-3-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4566:\"<p>WordPress 5.0.3 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.0.3 is a maintenance release that includes 37 bug fixes and 7 performance updates.

The new era of &#8220;Happy Publishing&#8221; in 2019 will bring even more progress on that roadmap, enabling users to have a more unified editing experience for other aspects of content management, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">widgets and menus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 23:44:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: GitHub Announces Free, Unlimited Private Repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86657\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/github-announces-free-unlimited-private-repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3488:\"<p>GitHub users no longer have to pay to keep code private. The company is now offering <a href=\"https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlimited private repositories to Free account users</a>, with up to three collaborators. Developers have different reasons for wanting to keep their code private &#8211; it may not be ready, they may be working on a side project, or may just be starting out in their coding journey. GitHub now makes it possible for users with free accounts to do that work in private, without having to upgrade to a Pro account for $7/month.</p>\n<p>This change brings the code hosting site more in line with competitors like GitLab.com, which allows for unlimited private projects and collaborators, and Bitbucket, a platform that has offered this for much longer. Bitbucket was actually <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4428278\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab&#8217;s inspiration for this model</a>. </p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s announcement was well-received but for many who have already moved to GitLab, this news come too late. Some are also wary of giving GitHub access to their private projects after Microsoft acquired the company for $7.5 billion last year. However, GitHub seems to be focusing its efforts less on monetizing the small fish and more on evolving the company&#8217;s Enterprise offering. It has combined its Business Cloud and Enterprise products into one unified &#8220;GitHub Enterprise&#8221; product that starts at $21/user/month.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the GitHub update is so bigmega giantcorp can get you to give them more info &amp; in turn more power &amp; in turn more money, if that\'s annoying &amp;/or unsavory to you there are alternatives (that are less convenient but that\'s what this is all about anyway) no grump just fact</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jon Christopher (@jchristopher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jchristopher/status/1082353226329001985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;At GitLab we think that repositories will become a commodity,&#8221; GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/07/github-offering-free-private-repos-for-up-to-three-collaborators/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in reaction to GitHub&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;I think Microsoft will try to generate more revenue with people using Azure more instead of paying for repos. We&#8217;re focusing on making a single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle that can replace a lot of other tools.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>Every inch given in this space makes code sharing platforms more competitive. In terms of private repositories, GitHub has come close to offering what its smaller competitors have been giving away for free for a long time. If GitHub were to add Continuous Integration (CI) for free users to match GitLab&#8217;s free tier, for example, it might capture even more of the market. Different features sway different types of users to adopt one platform or another and eventually some of those turn into paying customers.</p>\n<p>For existing GitHub Free users, unlimited private repositories means the opportunity to keep their incomplete projects out of the public eye, instead of having people stumble on them and wonder why they don&#8217;t work as expected. It also frees up a few more dollars for Pro users who want to downgrade to Free accounts.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 18:46:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: December 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/the-month-in-wordpress-december-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3528:\"<p>New features, a big event, and important announcements marked December as a milestone month for the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Release of WordPress 5.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 6 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/\">WordPress 5.0 was released</a>.

It is not clear what actions will be within the realm of possibility with the current benevolent dictator model WordPress has used. Part of the scope of the project is to &#8220;propose a leadership and governance model for the WordPress open source project and its communities.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\'s part of the job: to figure out how it can and should work.

The second aspect of the project that aims to get WordPress a seat at the table seems more feasible and more likely to be well-received by the project&#8217;s leadership. It might make more sense to split up the two objectives into different projects. WordPress&#8217; internal governance and its role in the greater web are very different topics, but the project&#8217;s creators seem to view them as inseparable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg hasn&#8217;t joined in the Twitter conversation about governance but he did address the topic on a recent <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-on-gutenberg/\">Post Status podcast episode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When he was talking about open governance, my take was that he was talking about getting WordPress a seat at the table, and discussing these regulation changes and et cetera happening,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I think the example last year was that there was this meeting at 10 Downing Street. Who was there? Was WordPress represented?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And he started talking about the Web Foundation, and I began thinking, “Wow, WordPress only represents a third of websites, and not even, really. It’s a third of the top 10 million. Another foundation like the Web Foundation actually might be a better vehicle to try to advocate on the open Web as a whole, versus just the people who happen to be using a single CMS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked more about WordPress&#8217; leadership structure, Mullenweg reviewed the different approaches he has taken with the project. In 2018, the expression of his BDFL-style leadership was manifestly more overt than previous years, which may have influenced or even inspired the creation of the WordPress Governance Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s been a lot more leaders, but I would actually argue the point that WordPress has always been sort of my vision being set, or even my direct leadership,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There was a good four or five years there where the leadership structure, because we’ve experimented with lots of different &#8211; we don’t call it governance &#8211; but essentially leadership structures in WordPress. For a while, we had kind of the … It wasn’t a committee approach, but essentially like the lead developers consensus approach. We did that for a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even from the beginning it wasn’t just me. It was me and Mike Little, so it’s never been solo. Then we went to where the release lead was the final decider, including over me, so that was probably, I don’t know, 3.9 to 4.7 maybe, that included overruling me as project lead for what was in the release or not, and that was to try to give a little more autonomy and flexibility to release leads. But the big change was a few years ago I said, &#8216;Okay, I’m going to take back over core WordPress development,&#8217; and that was to try to make some of these big changes happen. So right now it is much more of a benevolent dictator model, although both of those words are questionable. But, I don’t see that as the permanent forever structure.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg may not be able to sustain this level of involvement in core leadership indefinitely, with all of his other responsibilities at Automattic. He said he is open to WordPress empowering other leaders in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m not saying it always has to be me, but what I want is a strong, opinionated, thoughtful leader setting a bold direction, taking experiments and being willing to fail, comfortable with failure, is I think what you need to create great software,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian DeConinck, a WordPress developer who has recently been a vocal critic of the project&#8217;s leadership, called for more transparency around the decision-making process in his <a href=\"http://www.briandeconinck.com/initial-thoughts-wordpress-governance/\">initial thoughts on the governance project.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Matt is the central figure of the WordPress project,&#8221; DeConinck said. &#8220;He’s been a guiding force since the beginning. Without a doubt, he’s an important and valued member of our community. I don’t imagine governance as a means of usurping him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But should there be a single human face at the head of a project and a community at this scale? When people are critical of decision-making, having Matt at the center makes it easy to make criticism needlessly personal. This dynamic is hard on Matt and others in the project leadership, and ultimately toxic for the community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeConinck said in order for the governance project to be successful he thinks it needs to be international, multicultural, and multilingual, with diverse voices, as well as clear mechanisms for WordPress users to provide feedback. He outlined a detailed list of success criteria that hasn&#8217;t officially been embraced by governance project as it has yet to hold its first meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeConinck&#8217;s suggestions are incompatible with the current BDFL-style leadership, as he claims that &#8220;feedback from a community of millions of users can’t adequately be processed and acted upon by a single individual listening and making decisions for the project.&#8221; WordPress has risen to become a dominant force on the web during the past 15 years under this style of leadership. Any meaningful proposal of change to the leadership structure will need to demonstrate how the new model can continue to enable WordPress to make rapid progress and maintain its relevance on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress Governance Project Flagged as Unofficial and Removed from WordPress.org</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this morning, WordPress Community Team representative Francesca Marano <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/01/07/wordpress-governance-project-change-of-venue/\">posted a notice</a> on behalf of the governance project&#8217;s leadership to announce that the project has been removed from WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Concerns have been raised about the posting of news about the WordPress Governance Project on make.wordpress.org and use of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-team/\">#community-team</a> Slack channel giving the impression the project is sanctioned as an official WordPress project,&#8221; Marano said. &#8220;It has not received such sanctions from WordPress leadership.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We went through what we believed were the appropriate channels for launching the project through the Community group (ie speaking to group members, asking for access to the Make blog, coordinating with the team and others to find a meeting time which didn’t collide with others, etc),&#8221; Morten Rand-Hendriksen said. &#8220;We were later informed the project was not sanctioned by WordPress leadership and therefore cannot use the Make blog or Slack.&#8221; He would not comment further on what transpired or the communication his team received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, it looks like the governance project will need to prove its worth independently before being officially adopted by WordPress. Many other community-led efforts and tools have followed this same process before coming under the umbrella of core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project now has its own dedicated website at <a href=\"https://wpgovernance.com/\">wpgovernance.com</a> and a Slack instance at <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/twgp/signup?x=x-517030675360-517548723457\">twgp.slack.com</a>. The first meeting was set for January 8 but has been postponed to January, 15, 1600 UTC to allow participants to sign up at the new Slack workspace.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Jan 2019 19:49:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Beaver Builder Doubles Down on Serving Power Users in Response to Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86569\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/beaver-builder-doubles-down-on-serving-power-users-in-response-to-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3074:\"<p>At WordCamp US I had the opportunity to chat with <a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/\">Beaver Builder</a> co-founder Robby McCullough about how the page builder is navigating the Gutenberg era. The proliferation of blocks for the new editor has made it easy for non-technical WordPress users to add things like pricing tables, maps, tabs, accordions, and other UI elements. Future iterations of Gutenberg will soon tackle layouts. These improvements to core will radically change how page builder products are marketed to WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the decisions we made in response to the news of Gutenberg early on is that we wanted to double down on our professional power users,&#8221; McCullough said. &#8220;It took us a long time in our growth as a business to figure out who our customers were. We realized there were two distinct camps: one that was like a do-it-yourselfer type, someone who maybe had a small business or a hobby website who wanted to use WordPress but wasn&#8217;t familiar with writing code. The other was more of a freelancer &#8211; maybe a one or two person agency, people who were building lots of websites and had development and frontend skills. We see that as the space where we want to live now. We&#8217;re hoping to continue solving problems and making the experience better for folks with a few more skills in their tool belts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following up with McCullough later, he said that applying this new direction to Beaver Builder is already translating into the features they are prioritizing for the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For example, in our latest major release, we added percent, em, rem, and viewport-based units for things like font sizes, margins, and padding,&#8221; McCullough said. &#8220;Without a basic understanding of CSS, this feature wouldn&#8217;t be too helpful. We also added dozens of pre-built row templates. So, instead of creating single-page designs, our goal was to create a modular system of rows that can be mixed and matched to build out sites. We&#8217;re working to build features that better enable folks who build lots of websites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interview below we discussed the current integration between Gutenberg and Beaver Builder. McCullough said his team is considering bringing blocks into Beaver Builder or bringing Beaver Builder content into Gutenberg; both are possibilities. His team has been waiting to see how quickly the community adopts Gutenberg before making any major decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My hope is that there&#8217;s still going to be a place for page builders, Beaver Builder and everyone in this space, to have a little bit more agility,&#8221; McCullough said. &#8220;We can see Gutenberg kind of be like Instagram in that it&#8217;s going to appeal to a mass audience. We like to live in the Photoshop space where you&#8217;re going to get a lot of fine-tuned controls, solving problems and creating features that are going to help people build websites every day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Jan 2019 20:20:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: WP Storybook: A Handy Reference for WordPress React UI Components\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86604\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-storybook-a-handy-reference-for-wordpress-react-ui-components\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1553:\"<p><a href=\"https://lubus.in/\">LUBUS</a>, a web design agency in Mumbai, has published a site called <a href=\"https://wp-storybook.netlify.com/\">WP Storybook</a> that offers an interactive way to explore various WordPress React components.

The campaign is focused around the question: &#8220;What Would You Do If You Could Do Anything?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com published its inaugural <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2019/01/03/introducing-the-2019-anything-is-possible-list/\">‘Anything Is Possible’ List</a>, which includes 10 mini-documentaries ranging from 1 minute to 1:44. A few of the stories highlighted include Congolese-American sisters operating a successful hair salon in NYC, a 12-year-old journalist running her own online publication, a blogger who went viral and published her own book, and a non-profit fighting misinformation and extremist narratives. Each is presented more in depth on a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/do-anything/\">Do Anything</a> campaign site that was launched today.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Do Anything is WordPress.com&#8217;s first large-scale national brand campaign. It will debut TV, print, and digital advertising spots in The New Yorker and on TV networks, including The History Channel, CNN, and National Geographic. WordPress.com will also be running ads on podcasts, including The Daily and NPR. The new 30-second TV ad was created by <a href=\"http://interestingdevelopment.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Interesting Development</a>, an agency based in New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like gym memberships, WordPress.com tends to see more action at the beginning of a new year with 20% more sites are created in January than the average, according to Mark Armstrong at Automattic. The timing for the campaign is aimed at tapping into the motivation that millions of users have for starting a new business or blog at this time of year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Automattic started <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/marketing-at-automattic/\">hiring for more marketing positions</a> as an answer to Wix, Weebly, Squarespace, Web.com, EIG, and Godaddy, competitors that Matt Mullenweg identified as having spent over $350M in advertising that year. In 2017, the company created <a href=\"https://design.blog/2017/05/18/how-a-detroit-hackathon-turned-into-wordpress-coms-first-ever-tv-spots/\">five commercials</a>, its first ever TV spots, as part of a series called &#8220;Free to be.&#8221; Many found the commercials to be confusing and the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-tv-commercials-are-confusing\">messaging wasn&#8217;t clear</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, the 2019 &#8220;Do Anything&#8221; campaign is much better at demonstrating what people can do with WordPress.  &#8220;As we share new work with the world we realize that some things will hit and some things will miss,&#8221; Automattic’s SVP of Brand, Michelle Broderick said. The company has continued to evolve its marketing based on feedback. This particular campaign was directly inspired by the people who are making things happen with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were inspired by the people who use WordPress to imagine a better world,&#8221; Broderick said. &#8220;We saw everyone from bloggers to business owners to scientists to politicians using WordPress to share their story.&#8221;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new TV spot is an improvement over previous campaigns in terms of communicating a clear message, but it doesn&#8217;t carry the same authenticity as the mini-documentaries. Each one is relatable and inspiring in telling the stories of people who have already answered the question &#8220;What would you do if you could do anything?&#8221; Many of those who were featured have carried on with their dreams through perseverance, despite tragedy and struggle along the way. The documentaries are more poignant than the TV spot, which has the added constraint of having to capture the viewer&#8217;s attention with a shorter amount of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Do Anything&#8221; campaign as a whole is a good representation of the power of WordPress and should also help boost name recognition for the software in general. Broderick said Automattic is expecting tens of millions of impressions across TV, print, digital, and podcasts. The campaign is aimed at the American market but Armstrong said they hope to branch out into international markets in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Jan 2019 20:05:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"HeroPress: YOU Make The Difference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2672\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://heropress.com/essays/you-make-the-difference/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=you-make-the-difference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10124:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/010219-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress still attracts the same types of people. Those who are brave, who are kind, who are looking to the future.\" /><blockquote><p>“A place is only as good as the people you know in it. It&#8217;s the people that make the place.”</p>\n<p>― Pittacus Lore, I Am Number Four</p></blockquote>\n<p>This quote is a large part of the space WordPress holds within me.</p>\n<p>Coming from a career in Civil Engineering and a background of Industrial Technology WordPress as a software drew me as a tool. It was a means to an end. I wasn’t blogging, I wasn’t looking to create an online voice, I was looking to build something and I needed a tool.</p>\n<p>I was good at learning software, had used over a dozen very complicated systems by that point in my life, so I found WordPress and started learning it too.</p>\n<p>A very melodramatic discovery story of WordPress for a HeroPress piece, I know.</p>\n<p>The truth is I probably wouldn’t have stuck around were it not for the people. The story has evolved for me over the years but that’s the beginning. The beginnings are usually far less romantic than the endings in any story.</p>\n<p>So why was I looking for a tool? Well, that’s a bit better of a story.</p>\n<h3>Looking For A Tool</h3>\n<p>I’ll prep you with the fact that I was driven, opinionated, blunt, and defensive. I had spent my college years and first years in my chosen career in a male-dominated industry. I learned how to navigate and thrive and took a job at a very large Engineering firm. About a year in I was granted a fantastic opportunity to work on a small startup team that was doing amazing work in 3D scanning.</p>\n<p>Being a startup team demanded that we produce more and more work to determine the viability of the investment the firm was making in my boss’s plans. As we worked on landing deals that required overnight travel and training that required days away it brought to the surface a reality that wasn’t so good for me. As the only woman on the team, I doubled the travel budget. They needed two of everything for me since I couldn’t bunk up with my male coworkers.</p>\n<p>The next months were a perfect storm of events. I made an opinionated comment to a division supervisor that was above my pay grade which enhanced my visibility as a problem. Then I got pregnant.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can’t walk around 3D scanning a PVC manufacturing facility while with child. They also don’t make maternity coveralls.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was officially dead weight. I lost the pregnancy and became depressed, anxious. It was easy for them to let me go then, I had stopped being productive. I found out a couple weeks after losing my job I was pregnant again. Talk about a whirlwind.</p>\n<p>My husband was in the process of changing careers from Retail to Healthcare and maternity leave is not something you like to bring up on an interview, so I decided to find something to do from home. I started a local family newsletter and decided to create an online marketplace for moms who craft out of their homes, like a local Etsy. This is where my search for a tool began.</p>\n<h3>Starting Again</h3>\n<p>A few months later, with no WordPress experience other than what I managed to rake together while I was learning and building, I got a job at WPMUDEV doing product support. I needed the extra cash so my other projects took a backseat and I was soon completely engulfed. Through that job, I came to learn about the ecosystem that was WordPress. I had no idea that there was a place that existed outside of the corporate universe that could exist without sexist politics, hierarchy, and status quo. It was mind-blowing.</p>\n<p>I was so hungry for people to interact with after being in such a team-oriented environment for so long. I loved working with others and I felt very alone until I found this great group of people. And oh what joy when I found it! I was a new mom at home with a baby trying to learn how to handle that new space in my life. My husband had completed a successful career change and we had moved. I had another baby. I met my friend Mason and we started a business together. I lost another pregnancy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the space of two short years, my life had completely turned upside down and landed me in the place that would help me survive it all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You see, without the people, I wouldn’t have made it. I wouldn’t have been able to navigate the overwhelming waters that surrounded me outside of my day to day work. The people who befriended me, who were kind to me, who made jokes with me, who valued my contribution and intelligence without ever having set eyes on me, those were the people who kept me sane. They let me see I didn’t need to be defensive, that I didn’t have to be sorry about being opinionated, that I was different and that I should lean into that.</p>\n<p>When I left product support to work with Mason at, what was formerly called, WP Valet it was yet another major shift in my life. The product space was so different than the agency space and I quickly adapted to the new pace. There was a rush of excitement while learning new things and applying skills that had laid dormant for some time. My father was a Navy man and an entrepreneur and shaped so much of how I applied myself, now I was in a place to push myself even further and define my own path. I was spoiled by my first interactions at WP Valet with developers like Zé Fontainhas and Mario Peshev. The whole thing was thrilling!</p>\n<h3>And Then I Went To WordCamp</h3>\n<p>My first WordCamp was WordCamp Miami 2013. It was probably the first time I’d traveled alone in some time and I was meeting my work family for the first time. On top of that, I was in MIAMI, so it was bound to be a great trip. I got to meet David Bisset and Lisa Sabin Wilson that year, and so many other wonderful people. I was on cloud 9, each and every personality was inspiring to me, all so different than what my former colleagues and field specialists were like. To top it off I walked into my first talk at a WordCamp, Pippin Wilson was talking about how developers should share code. I was beside myself, sharing your code and supporting each other? Not cutthroat over projects and billable hours?! I was swooning over the idea of ‘community’ and what I had stumbled into.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Needless to say, I left 100% hooked on my path. WordPress was my life from that time on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We as people have long-tailed stories that weave and zigzag and turn back on themselves. We are products of ALL the things going on in our lives at any given moment. Without the personal struggles and the professional push, I would not have been able to value the community as much as I do. The overlapping of personal and professional trials and successes are what gives depth to our experiences. Their overlapping is what colors the story of our lives.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years through a cross-state move, speaking selections, the birth of another child, a company expansion, another pregnancy loss, a company rebranding, a company restructuring, a return to school for Yoga training, and all the other things life throws in your path with family and work and here I sit typing my story at my counter while my middle child hums ‘Mamma Mia’ next to me. I am forever grateful for the life that I’ve been able to live through a whole new career in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>You Make The Difference</h3>\n<p>I am grateful for every soul I have met. I had the privilege to work with and become friendly with some of the nicest and most genuine people I will ever meet online and face to face. The ecosystem of WP has changed a lot over the years as most ecosystems do, but it still attracts the same types of people. Those who are brave, who are kind, who are looking to the future. My world is so much bigger because of all you.

He asked me to revisit the WordPress mission, “Democratize Publishing,” and reflect on what that mission means to me today. So here you go, Toru: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, my definition of “Democratize Publishing” has been simply to help make the web a more open place. That foundation begins with the software itself, as outlined by the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/\">Four Freedoms</a>: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>0. The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Toru noted in the original question, “Democratize Publishing” has come to mean many things to many people in the WordPress community. That’s one reason I like it. The WordPress mission is not just for one person to define. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’d like to ask everyone: What does “Democratize Publishing” mean to you? &nbsp;<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:06:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Matt: Sponcon Posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48788\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"https://ma.tt/2018/12/sponcon-posts/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:422:\"<p>I found <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/influencers-are-faking-brand-deals/578401/\">this post by Taylor Lorenz</a> describing how aspiring influencers are posting fake, unpaid sponsored content to raise their status or hoping to nab a real sponsorship <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/influencers-are-faking-brand-deals/578401/\">is totally bananas</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 16:08:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress Designers Explore Ideas for Moving Navigation to a Block Interface\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86518\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-designers-explore-ideas-for-moving-navigation-to-a-block-interface\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5176:\"<p>Creating a block for navigation menus is one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">nine projects</a> Matt Mullenweg identified for 2019 that will make a big impact for WordPress users.

Sites with automatic background updates enabled should already be on the latest version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release addresses performance issues, one of the chief complaints for users who have adopted the block editor. It brings 45 improvements to the editor, with 14 of those related to performance and 31 bug fixes. According to Gary Pendergast, &#8220;the cumulated performance gains make it 330% faster for a post with 200 blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This maintenance release also fixes 17 editor-related bugs in the default WordPress themes as well as internationalization issues related to script loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, 5.0.2 updates have gone smoothly, with the exception of a few conflicts with a handful of plugins. Most notably, WooCommerce store administrators found that the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/22271\">Orders tab had disappeared</a> after their sites updated. WooCommerce has fixed the issue in a quick patch release (version 3.5.3) that was pushed out this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NextGEN Gallery creator Erick Danzer also reported <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1545334477273500\">a minor issue with the Classic block</a> that prevents users from editing galleries via the placeholder the plugin had added.

It includes the rules of the game, cleverly adapted to the concept of Gutenblox:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Blocks treat Paragraphs, Headings, Media, etc. all as components that strung together make up the tower. Replacing the traditional concept of board games, Gutenblox is designed with progressive enhancement, meaning as new blocks are added to the top of the tower, they are backward compatible with all legacy content (although the legacy structure may become unstable as new blocks are added on).</p><p>We hope to offer rich value to players who will start with the foundation of a stable, accessible, and secure architecture, and then use a simple drag-and-drop method for modification.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a last-minute holiday gift or birthday gift for a friend who loves WordPress, Gutenblox is fun option.

Instead, it was a genuinely noble and pragmatic effort to make WordPress, and thus publishing on the web, as widely available as possible.</p>\n<p>Despite the reaction from many developers (and security-minded sysadmins), that strategy worked: WordPress <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">powers over 30% of the web</a>, and a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">significant chunk of those installations are on unsupported PHP versions</a>. For those users, it&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t care that they are on an unsupported version of PHP; they just don&#8217;t know, or don&#8217;t know how to solve the problem.</p>\n<p>But the winds of progress are blowing, and in 2019 WordPress is planning to make a change. Assuming everything goes according to plan, PHP 5.6 will become the minimum supported version in the first half of the year, and the minimum version will be bumped again to PHP 7 in the second half of 2019.</p>\n<p>There are obvious benefits here from a security perspective. The oldest versions of PHP supported by WordPress today stopped receiving official security updates ages ago (PHP 5.2 hit EOL, or &#8220;end-of-life,&#8221; nearly 8 years ago). The speed improvements will be tremendous as well, particularly in PHP 7. Speaking from my own experience, I have several sites that once needed aggressive caching to prevent server overload. Since PHP 7, they run faster than ever, without caching of any kind.</p>\n<p>Speed and security are the two most-cited reasons (and the most measurable reasons) for bumping the minimum version, but there are also other less tangible benefits that will filter well beyond WordPress core development.</p>\n<h3>Simplified support</h3>\n<p>While plugin developers have never been obligated to support all the versions of PHP that WordPress core does, many still chose to do so. That&#8217;s understandable: it could be tough to explain to a user why they can install WordPress in a certain development environment but couldn&#8217;t install a certain plugin.</p>\n<p>For plugins that tried to match core&#8217;s backward compatibility support, that means testing and supporting up to nine versions of PHP: 5.2 through 5.6, and 7.0 through 7.3. (There was no PHP 6. I won&#8217;t bother explaining the <a href=\"https://ma.ttias.be/php6-missing-version-number/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">boring reasons why</a>.)</p>\n<p>By pushing to 5.6, and eventually some version of PHP 7+, that cuts the number of versions that developers will feel compelled to support in half. In some way, Core will likely continue to support these old versions (through security backports to old versions of WordPress, for instance) but plugin developers can be assured that they don&#8217;t need to — and don&#8217;t need to feel any semblance of guilt about it either.</p>\n<h3>Happier developers</h3>\n<p>Even developers who are excited about the WordPress platform as a whole are likely to admit that it&#8217;s maybe not the most exciting code-base in the world. Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve seen a number of examples of developers who once limited themselves to WordPress now stretching into other frameworks and languages: Laravel, JavaScript, and Go are all popular new homes for WordPress expats.</p>\n<p>Bumping the minimum version won&#8217;t change that apathy or exodus overnight, but it will give developers something to feel excited about. Modern PHP versions (especially PHP 7) offer genuinely cool new language features that make it easy to write performant, well-designed, and interesting code. I would even argue that it makes it fun. Modern PHP contains plenty of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">syntactic sugar</a>, and while you shouldn&#8217;t base your diet on sugar it certainly makes for a nice treat.</p>\n<p>Again, it is unlikely that core will start adopting these new language features on day one. The real benefit is that developers will feel empowered and secure in their decisions to start using these new capabilities, and will start to build plugins and themes that can borrow ideas from best practices in the broader PHP community.</p>\n<h3>Celebrating the intangible</h3>\n<p>While the measurable justifications for changing the minimum PHP version are certainly compelling, I think it&#8217;s also important to acknowledge these intangibles and indeed celebrate them. Bumping these versions will create a ripple effect across the ecosystem that will make developers more comfortable with writing modern code. It will reduce support and QA loads for companies that no longer need to support 9 different versions of PHP. It will make WordPress core a more attractive place to contribute.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg, and all the modern tooling and architecture it brought, has already reinvigorated developers across the ecosystem and brought a huge number of new core contributors (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contributing-to-gutenberg-a-new-contributors-experience\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">myself among them</a>). Embracing modern PHP is another step forward, and with other changes on the horizon (such as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/09/on-wordpress-git/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">move from SVN to Git</a>, coding standards changes, and projects like <a href=\"https://www.wptide.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tide</a> which embrace new languages and architectures) I hope that 2019 will be the year WordPress delivers not only a best-in-class user experience, but a best-in-class developer experience too.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 17:57:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Chris Van Patten\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg for Writers: How to Configure the Editor for Fewer Distractions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86427\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-for-writers-how-to-configure-the-editor-for-fewer-distractions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4740:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/8Y0EDX4VP9\">Green Chameleon</a>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time I could not compose posts with the Gutenberg editor. I tested each release of the plugin throughout its journey into WordPress 5.0, but found it too distracting for my basic needs. It seemed better suited for building a brochure website, not for someone who uses WordPress primarily for writing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first thing you see on a vanilla install of WordPress when you go to the &#8220;Add New&#8221; post page:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-12-17-at-10.14.35-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it may not be immediately evident, the new editor actually has some built-in controls for improving the writing experience. They are tucked away behind the vertical ellipsis menu at the top of the screen. Here&#8217;s how to configure Gutenberg for writing:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Hide the Settings Sidebar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step towards a more distraction-free writing experience is to hide the settings. Click the X at the top right of the screen.  If you&#8217;re trying to stay in the flow of writing, it&#8217;s not necessary to keep the block and document settings in view at all times. You can always toggle them on later when you&#8217;re finished getting your thoughts onto the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Turn on &#8220;Fullscreen Mode&#8221;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many new and experienced WordPress users are not aware of Gutenberg&#8217;s &#8220;Fullscreen mode&#8221; that places the writing area in the center of the page and hides WordPress&#8217; admin menu sidebar.  This setting is a must for keeping distractions at bay. You can find it at the top right corner in the vertical ellipsis menu:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Once Fullscreen Mode is enabled, the writing area is greatly improved, with distractions removed from both sides of the content area. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Fix the Toolbar to the Top (optional)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block toolbar popping in and out of view was the bane of my Gutenberg experience until they developed the &#8220;Top Toolbar&#8221; setting. By default, the block-level toolbar obscures part of the content above it (as seen in the image below) and an obtrusive blue outline follows your mouse as you move over the paragraphs you have already written.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological affect of all these boxes popping in and out of view may be more taxing for some writers, so this step is optional. The &#8220;Top Toolbar&#8221; setting to hide the block-level toolbar, as well as the blue block outlines, is also inside the vertical ellipsis menu at the top. The best way to see the difference in the experience is to experiment with turning it on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotlight mode takes it one step further and greys out all the content except the current block, allowing writers to focus on one block at a time. When it is enabled, the blocks that are not being edited will partially fade away and no block outlines will be visible. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Spotlight mode\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg still has a way to go before it can provide a truly distraction-free editing experience. None of the modes highlighted above will hide the metaboxes at the bottom or the menu bar at the top. They do, however, allow you to compose in an area without the block-level toolbar and sidebars getting in the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My thoughts don&#8217;t always come out in full sentences and paragraphs. Sometimes they are scattered throughout a document in half sentences, single words, quotes, and fragments of quotes that I&#8217;m not certain I will use. How do I reconcile this with Gutenberg? Sometimes the Classic Block is a good option for a first draft that looks more like a pile of messy notes than a document of well-formed thoughts. Here&#8217;s what that looks like if you have never used it:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Classic Block\n\n\n\n<p>Even with these settings available, some writers may still prefer to use a dedicated writing app instead of the WordPress editor. Fortunately, Gutenberg has very good support for copying and pasting from other applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top Toolbar, Spotlight, and Fullscreen modes are not the easiest features to discover but they can make a significant impact on your experience writing in the new editor. WordPress core may never provide a truly distraction-free writing experience, but that&#8217;s where the beauty of the plugin system comes into play. It gives developers the opportunity to create new and interesting approaches towards a better default writing experience. I hope to see some of those popping up in the directory as more users adopt Gutenberg.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 03:17:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.0.2 to Bring Major Performance Improvements, Scheduled for December 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86358\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-2-to-bring-major-performance-improvements-scheduled-for-december-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3081:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/stopwatch.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Processed with VSCOcam with c1 preset</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/wordpress-5-0-1-security-release/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 5.0.1</a> was released yesterday as a security release with fixes for seven vulnerabilities that were privately disclosed.

It will include Gutenberg 4.7, Twenty Nineteen bug fixes, and a few PHP 7.3 compatibility fixes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gschoppe.com/wordpress/benchmarking-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Slow performance</a> as compared to the classic editor has been a commonly-reported <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/6466\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> with Gutenberg.

That might enable people to fly in on an early morning flight and still get to experience part of the contributor day and all of the main event. </p>\n<p>In a community this large, with many other holidays and WordCamps already on the calendar, it&#8217;s difficult to find a date for WordCamp US that doesn&#8217;t have conflicts. This is a good problem for the community to have. Matt Mullenweg shared during the State of the Word that the community has experienced 50% year over year growth with more than 350K members in 687 meetup groups and more than 5,000 meetup events. With this rate of growth, the community can expect more regional and local camps to spring up in the coming years, which means more conflicts but also more options for getting together in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:43:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Now Features a Curated Section for Block-Enabled Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86331\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-now-features-a-curated-section-for-block-enabled-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4065:\"<p>If you visit the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plugin directory</a>, you will notice a new section at the top featuring block-enabled plugins. WordPress 5.0 has been downloaded more than 8 million times, just one week after its release, and users are looking for blocks to extend the new editing experience. WordPress.org is highlighting plugins to push the block ecosystem forward and will soon be doing the same for themes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-13-at-9.35.13-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>There are currently 94 blocks in the featured section. In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2018/12/07/blocks-plugins-and-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on make.wordpress.org/plugins, Samuel (Otto) Wood invited developers to email the plugins team at plugins@wordpress.org if they have a block-enabled plugin that they want to be included. The basic requirements are a plugin that introduces or improves blocks.</p>\n<p>I asked Otto how they select from submissions. He said the plugins team is curating the list manually and adding those they think are good or interesting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a high bar; if it has a neat block, we&#8217;ll add it for now,&#8221; Otto said. &#8220;We may raise the bar depending on how big the section gets, and the section is not final by any means. We&#8217;ll change the inclusions according to how it works out. The goal is to promote neat and cool integrations, but there aren&#8217;t a lot of those yet. It&#8217;s new.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Assigning a tag to block-enabled plugins that authors could opt into would eliminate the need for manual approval on the section, but Otto said they are currently handling it more like a showcase.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Letting the plugin authors just add a tag would reduce the available tags (it&#8217;s already limited to 5) as well as reducing the value of curation,&#8221; Otto said. &#8220;We may change that as well in the future, somehow. Nothing is set in stone right now, we just want to see people making cool blocks and see what happens with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A directory devoted entirely to blocks may also be coming to WordPress.org next year. In a recent post, Matt Mullenweg identified <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">9 Projects for 2019</a>, including &#8220;building a WordPress.org directory for discovering blocks, and a way to seamlessly install them.&#8221; This is a much larger task and requires WordPress to answer a few questions: Will plugins continue to be the primary delivery mechanism for blocks? Or will WordPress.org implement a system where users can download JS-only blocks, similar to the Gutenberg Cloud project? </p>\n<p>Three months ago, Otto <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-cloud-a-cross-platform-community-library-for-custom-gutenberg-blocks#comment-260894\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on a post about Gutenberg Cloud, saying that js-only blocks are likely only suited to frontend enhancements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I remain unconvinced that js-only blocks have a place which is meaningful other than the trivial layout based things that blocks can do,&#8221; Otto said. &#8220;Yes, you can build great looking blocks with JavaScript only, and since it’s an editor, that is a really big deal. But without any actual support on the backend to &#8216;do stuff of substance,&#8217; it is just visual glitter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Offering JS-only blocks through WordPress.org might also complicate block discovery if users don&#8217;t know whether to look for blocks in a plugin or via the JS-only block delivery system. There are a lot of unknowns in the block era that will require WordPress to make some decisions. Meanwhile, the ecosystem of block-enabled plugins will continue expanding as more users adopt the new editor and especially as widgets and menus are ported to blocks in phase 2 of the Gutenberg project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 21:32:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"Dev Blog: WordCamp US 2019 dates announced\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6496\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/wordcamp-us-2019-dates-announced/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:705:\"<p>Save the date! <a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/2018/12/12/wordcamp-us-2019-announcing-our-dates/\">The next WordCamp US</a> will be held on November 1-3, 2019, in beautiful <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/06/15/matt-mullenweg-announces-st-louis-as-wordcamp-us-2019-2020-host-city/\">St Louis, Missouri</a>.

WPCampus <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-seeks-to-raise-30k-for-gutenberg-accessibility-audit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched its crowdfunding campaign</a> at the end of November and more than $10K has come in towards the <a href=\"https://wpcampus.org/2018/11/fundraising-for-wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$30K goal</a>.</p>\n<p>The day before WordPress 5.0 was released, WPCampus announced that Automattic has pledged to ensure WPCampus&#8217; accessibility audit of Gutenberg is fully funded. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that they [Automattic] see that it is important,&#8221; Cherry said. &#8220;Even when they said they weren&#8217;t going to do it, I don&#8217;t think it was ever &#8216;We&#8217;re never going to;&#8217; it was just &#8216;Not right now.&#8217; For us, we couldn&#8217;t necessarily wait for &#8216;maybe we&#8217;ll do it later,&#8217; so that&#8217;s why we jumped on it and got the ball rolling. I think they saw an opportunity where they could step in and have the means to move this along even further. They see the value and I think that&#8217;s why they wanted to jump in. They also saw all the community effort going on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the interview below, Cherry discusses how leaders in the WPCampus community rallied to get the audit in motion. The organization has received seven responses from vendors and is currently in the selection process. She also shared a little bit about her conversation with Matt Mullenweg during his community office hours and their discussion about how WordPress is used in higher education.</p>\n<p>Cherry&#8217;s strategy in advocating for accessibility is to focus on slicing through the confusion surrounding accessibility problems with an emphasis on education and communication. Although WordPress has set accessibility standards, the project has fallen short on enforcing them. In addition to putting automated accessibility testing in place for core, Cherry said she would also like to get more support for helping theme and plugin authors meet accessibility standards. This would help ensure that the code WordPress.org puts on the web is more accessible for those who are creating customized sites.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 04:29:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0.1 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6498\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/wordpress-5-0-1-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4797:\"<p>WordPress 5.0.1 is now available.

I hope you enjoy this interview with Matt Mullenweg. It lasts for a while, but I think that it&#8217;s worth catching the whole thing. We cover a whole bunch of topics. I want to thank iThemes for being our partner for this episode. iThemes has been in the WordPress space for so, so long and they make many great products, whether you&#8217;re looking to secure your website, manage your plugins and themes and so much more. Go to iThemes.com to learn more and thanks so much to the team at iThemes for being a Post Status partner. Now here&#8217;s the show. So hello and welcome to Post Status Draft. Fresh off of the release of WordPress 5.0 and WordCamp US, I&#8217;m here with Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress. Hey Matt.Matt Mullenweg: Howdy, howdy. It&#8217;s good to see everyone again.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, it&#8217;s great to see you. You look comfortable. You must be somewhere that is something like home.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, I&#8217;m in actually New York City this week. I had a few meetings after the WordCamp and it&#8217;s also just one of my favorite cities to be especially this time of year. The lights and everything around Christmas time are just gorgeous, so it&#8217;s fun.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah. I&#8217;ve never been to New York City in the Christmas season, but it&#8217;s one of those bucket list type of things. So let&#8217;s start off with just how are you feeling post-release, post-event? How do you feel like things went overall?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Super energized. I&#8217;d say like day before the release was pretty nervewracking, but it went better than I think almost anyone hoped, including myself. There was a great energy at WordCamp of we were able to kind of &#8230; I think instead of arguing about whether we should do a release or not, should it be Thursday or Tuesday or next month or never, or all these sorts of different options, everyone would say, &#8220;Okay, it happens. The world didn&#8217;t end and what can we do next to make things better?&#8221; That kind of making things better conversation is where I find the WordPress community is most productive. It&#8217;s where you can really get all sorts of different ideas and you can really get to the point where it does make things better for our users.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah. And I tend to think generally people cool down when they&#8217;re in person versus when they&#8217;re online. So all the energy, the pent-up energy from working through all the things that have to do with the release over the course of two years and it finally comes on you, sometimes it just feels good to get it out at the end of the day. You let those bygones be bygones.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I felt like it was actually a pretty drama-free release and event. I didn&#8217;t see any major bugs come across. I asked some of the big hosts and some of the big plugin companies, I was like, &#8220;What are you all seeing? Are you seeing a bunch of stuff come through?&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t get much. Have you heard much feedback in terms of, are there a lot of bugs coming up? Are there are a lot of issues or has it been fairly smooth?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, what I&#8217;ve been telling you all year, that it would be anticlimactic, I was half right. The software was anticlimactic. Everything around the software was pretty intense.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Very climactic, yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But yeah, I actually didn&#8217;t realize it before I got on for State of the Word, but host site GoDaddy, others have already upgraded over a million sites. They&#8217;re seeing normal support loads, things like that. It&#8217;s like I said, ultimately what drives a release day is, is the software ready? And the software was ready and all the inputs, all the data, all the sort of normal things we look at were there. It was just one of these things where the people, we didn&#8217;t seem ready and that&#8217;s much harder to navigate. Sometimes getting it out there helps a lot, but it&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve seen throughout my entire professional software career is the longer you go between releases the harder they are. I&#8217;ve seen this in small teams, big teams, public, private, inside automatic, outside, whatever it is. If you can get to where you&#8217;re releasing more frequently, it just removes a ton of stress and burden on each individual release and I think makes for ultimately a much better process for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and I want to dig into more about the process. I was really surprised. I don&#8217;t think I saw a single person share your old blog post about the version 1.0 and the importance of shipping 1.0. Maybe we&#8217;re just getting really old. So referencing a blog post that&#8217;s that many years old is harder now. But yeah, I&#8217;ve been in the camp for a while now that it just seemed like you&#8217;ve got to get it out there. I felt like we always had an advantage in the WordPress landscape and this is one of the things I was worried about when you announced the big feature release style. Here are our three goals and we&#8217;re going to make the releases strategic to that. We had the benefit of iteration when we had the regular releases. So overall do you feel like the tradeoff of losing the regular major releases was worth it in order to get the big thing shipped?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I think of like Drupal, the struggles and the boundaries they had going from 6.0 to 7.0 to 8.0 and it was almost like a whole new thing. This was really our first time, in a really long time at least, maybe ever, that you feel like you update and it&#8217;s in some ways a whole new thing, and it was a long release cycle that led up to that. So do you think that tradeoff was worth it or do you think there was a tradeoff? Is my assumption a poor one?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, there was in that we didn&#8217;t do a major release for a year. We did slip some things that would previously be in major releases in the minor releases, in the 4.9.X kind of releases, so that helped. That&#8217;s a good question. I think that in 2019 we can do both. So we can keep some really super rapid public iteration and the feature plugins, and who knows, I&#8217;d actually love to see a few more kind of areas of WordPress that we want to innovate in or expand in, take more of this plugin approach. And then we also have a lot of great stuff in the hopper for some major releases. I think we&#8217;ll be able to do &#8230; there was a lot of talk at contributor day as we were looking at it.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It actually slipped my mind that we did that whole code reformatting and JavaScript reorganization in trunk, and that&#8217;s not in 5.0, right? Because we branched off 4.9.8 to make it as stable and as few changes as possible. So we&#8217;ve got actually, I think there&#8217;s another 200 patches already in trunk that weren&#8217;t in 5.0. So we&#8217;ve just got a lot of good stuff already in there, including the whole reorganization that you kind of put that together plus maybe ServeHappy and the white screen protection and some really cool stuff that&#8217;s kind of more like small stuff. That could be a 5.1 right there. I could see that going in the beta January, RC in February.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, talk about ServeHappy. I mean, for I don&#8217;t know, five, six, seven years, people have wanted, demanded PHP upgrades and it was a footnote in this state of the word.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I should have done it as one more thing.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: One more thing, yeah. Had to really get all the developers on your team for that one. So you made a commitment to in 2019 have a staggered upgrade process to mandate certain versions of PHP. Remind me if I&#8217;m incorrect, 5.6 in the Spring and 7.0 next winter. Is that basically the timeline?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, that&#8217;s the idea and we&#8217;re just going to go through. And again this is, just like with Gutenberg, it&#8217;s not about changing a version number or something. It&#8217;s really about bringing the whole community along for the ride, so we need to scan all the plugins. For 5.6, I think we&#8217;ll actually be able to update them or send patches to maintainers, even update and maintain plugins, because those changes are pretty easy. Seven is tougher and I think that is, we&#8217;re targeting December for that. I could see that slipping, just depending on whether host in the meantime and everyone else is able to get there, but even getting to 5.6 opens up a ton of possibilities, including with things like OAuth and GraphQL and namespaces, and there&#8217;s some pretty cool features. 5.6 is ancient at this point. It had a lot of improvements over 5.2.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: And a lot-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And we still have a lot of folks on these older versions, so part of the reason we&#8217;re giving ourselves time as well is to, if we can run some analytics to figure out which host these old sites are on Ron and reach out to them, try to work with them.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Do you think a part of the reason why you even think this is possible, for a long time, I mean, people were running WordPress across a huge spectrum of versions of PHP. Do you think part of the reason why you even think this possible is the hosting relationships that had been made between the community and the hosting companies over the past few years? Because that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve felt like has been quite significant. The efforts that, if you look at the big ones, the GoDaddy and the Bluehosts of the world, the amount of commitment they&#8217;re giving to the community, do you think that&#8217;s a big part of it? And how hard is the long tail going to be to capture, do you think?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That&#8217;s a big question. First, I&#8217;ll say that the improvement of hosts, particularly the big ones in becoming kind of like WordPress first, providing a really first-class WordPress experience from security updates, everything, it&#8217;s probably been the biggest change in the WordPress ecosystem over the past five years. And I have huge admiration for them because they&#8217;re doing this for millions of sites, thousands of support folks. They&#8217;re really moving some really, steering some really large ships and the results have been fantastic. We got, I think it was up to 68% of our WordPress was on 4.9 by the time 5.0 come out.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, that&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But in terms of what&#8217;s going to make the PHP upgrading easier, it&#8217;s really a combination of everything, including time, including some of this white screen protection stuff that we&#8217;re doing. If we can back port that, you know we still backport to 3.7 all of our security updates?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Which is kind of wild.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It is. It&#8217;s great for security of the Web broadly, but it&#8217;s quite something.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, if we can do that for some of this, maybe we can put some of this white screen upgrade protection into those old versions, so that way we can kind of protect people who might be doing plugin and theme or core updates from breaking their site in programmatic way. Um, it&#8217;s also the work that&#8217;s gone into updates. We know we migrated to a new data center this year for WordPress.org It&#8217;s like, I forget the exact or something like five or 10 times more powerful than the old one.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Wow.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Almost no one noticed. But you notice that there&#8217;s no more 503s when we run the updates, and things can go faster. This means we can do auto updates better, which means that we&#8217;ll be able to do opt-in for core and plugin and theme auto updates and then maybe move that to opt-out 2020. These are all just things that have been going on that represent thousands of hours of work from hundreds of people that set the stage so we can do stuff. It&#8217;s part of the reason I think that we will be able to move a lot faster in 2019. We had to stop core ,essentially freeze it for Gutenberg, because we were building a new foundation and you can&#8217;t build the house on top while you&#8217;re also pouring the concrete, right? Things will sink. They&#8217;ll get off center. I&#8217;ve never built a house so I don&#8217;t know this analogy all the way, but now we&#8217;ve got the foundation. We&#8217;ve got this framework and things being built on top of that framework. We&#8217;re already starting to see the benefits to things like keyboard navigation and accessibility when they&#8217;re built using Gutenberg fields that already have this kind of baked in.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: So I think that we have the opportunity to do just a massive upgrade not just of the editor but of every single plugin, every single theme, every single person&#8217;s experience with WordPress because think about it. No one just runs core. Cool if we do Gutenberg in core? Ultimately it doesn&#8217;t matter. Everyone&#8217;s got five, 10, 20 different plugins. They&#8217;ve got their theme which might implement who knows how many additional features baked into the theme? Probably dozens, if you think about all the customization options, that&#8217;s all going to be able to be reimagined now and already is. We see some of this, over 100 themes in the plugin directory. You might have noticed we put the Gutenberg-ready plugins at the very top, even above featured. We&#8217;re really trying to get everyone on this train.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Do you think there was a messaging gap in a trying to get across the idea that Gutenberg is a foundation rather than a window dressing or wallpaper or whatever other nonstructural housing component we want to compare it to?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, I think it&#8217;s easy to say that there was a messaging gap and that communication could have been 10 times better or whatever, because there are obviously some people who wren&#8217;t on board and still aren&#8217;t on board. So now, is there anything that could have gotten everyone 100 percent?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: No.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I don&#8217;t know, but I think we will always strive to do better. And ultimately, I mean, one of the things that made me pretty confident about the release wasn&#8217;t that Gutenberg is perfect. It&#8217;s not. By the way, it&#8217;s still not right for a ton of people, but that&#8217;s okay. You know WordPress, unlike almost every other SaaS service or software use gives you control. And the fact that we have classic editor as a first party supported official thing and that anyone for whatever reason, literally any reason, can still use the old experience instead. That&#8217;s what I meant when I said 5.0 was going to be anticlimactic, not that it meant Gutenberg was perfect or ready for everyone, but that forever was not wordy. They&#8217;re just a click or two away before or after the release from having the experience that they used to.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, one of the things I like to remind myself of is that neither was TinyMCE perfect or right for everyone.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, no.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: And that&#8217;s why it was being replaced. So I think sometimes we do have to look at what are we trying to replace and what do we have right now? Is that worth getting out into the world and iterating on?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Did you see those user tests videos?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I did. Unfortunately my wife said, &#8220;Do you want to go see the Harlem Globetrotters?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Absolutely.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have WordCamp US on my calendar yet.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, don&#8217;t worry, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So we double booked, so I re-watched the whole State of the Word, including the user tests, the Q and A, the whole thing, and it was pretty amazing seeing those user tests. I&#8217;ve seen people do user tests before. They&#8217;re often really terrible.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Painful.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: That&#8217;s why for years I&#8217;ve tried to make my own message that we need to continually support things that make WordPress easier to use, so I think that was a good thing to highlight in the State of the Word.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And by the way, I probably would&#8217;ve picked the Harlem Globetrotters over me as well, so o need to apologize.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It was the first one I&#8217;ve missed since like 2012.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m an average live experience. The Harlem Globetrotters are amazing live.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: They are.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: You can always catch State of the Word on vide later.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: They are. I may as well use the opportunity too to thank [David Bisset 00:15:39], because he did a fantastic job with both tweeting things and just generally keeping people that follow along with Post Status up to date and it turned out to be a good outlet for him because twitter banned his personal account because they thought that he was tweeting so much.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Wasn&#8217;t that wild?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I know. That guy is a national treasure of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: He is. He is. If there was a community spirit award, he should win it.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So he stood up to ask a question during the State of the Word and unfortunately ran out of time, so I would-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Right, I felt so bad that we didn&#8217;t get to &#8230; There were a lot of people in line, but just some of those earlier questions were a bit longer and I could tell the room was starting to, like I think we were already like an hour 45. We were pretty far into it, so &#8230;</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and maybe we&#8217;ve put a 30-second clock next year for people to ask a question.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I&#8217;ve been thinking about that, like there were some definitely things in the room this year, like it was very dark in the audience so it was a little harder to see. I think that also subdued people. There was a little more distance between the stage and the people which looked a little more theatrical, but I think also made the audience a bit more disconnected. And even, there was a funny thing. You saw the spotlight on the question askers?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It was so bright and at an angle that it was shining in the eyes of everyone sitting next to them. So after the first or second question there, there was a huge hole in the audience next to the mic because we were just getting like it had this crazy spotlight on it. I think we can figure out some different ways of doing lighting or doing the questions in the future that might be a bit a bit easier.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Well, you&#8217;ll have that opportunity in St Louis, right, for the next two years.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Woo hoo, St. Louis. I&#8217;m very excited about that.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I&#8217;m excited about that too. I haven&#8217;t been there in a long time, and what David-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I love that we&#8217;re doing the opposite of Amazon. They had the opportunity to pick any city in America and they go to D.C. and New York.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I know.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: They&#8217;re both amazing places, but not really shining a light on places that don&#8217;t get as much love already.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I think my-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And we&#8217;ve had Philly, Nashville and now St. Louis, I really dig the WordCamp US thing.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah. I have feeling that Amazon may have been including some political reasoning and in their strategy for that, but that&#8217;s okay. WordPress doesn&#8217;t have to do that. We can go wherever we want.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: We can go to Canada, which was one of the questions, which I thought was kind of cool.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Including Canada, which was a good question. I actually had that brought up to me before WordCamp about the U.S./Europe thing and whether we can learn from that and have WordCamp Americas or something.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, what&#8217;s your thought on Central America in that equation?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I mean I think that there&#8217;s a lot of cultural differences, but I think anything Americas, there&#8217;s some common themes of people that work hard, people that explored many centuries ago. So I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m probably not the best person to answer that type of question, but &#8230;</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I&#8217;ve been thinking about it a lot, like what are the logical divisions and because we do have some rules in the WordCamp world around like what could be &#8230; I&#8217;d love to see a WordCamp Asia, for example. Asia is obviously geographically, culturally and language-wise, incredibly diverse.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Right, I think the lingual differentiation would be a challenge, so I don&#8217;t know what the best regions would be but perhaps-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But then look in Europe.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It has a ton of languages [inaudible 00:19:08] English.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I always envy friends in Europe because they all speak like five languages plus, and some of them speak better English than I do.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, for sure. Have you ever seen a map of the lower 48 overlaid over Europe?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, it&#8217;s very, very similar in size, so-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, it&#8217;s actually, you forget how large actually the lower 48 of the U.S. is that it covers kind of like into Europe, pretty far into Russia and Turkey and Middle East.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah. We think of Alabama and Houston or Birmingham, Alabama and Houston, Texas as pretty close, but that could be different countries if we were in Europe with different languages and culture. It&#8217;s a reminder of the diversity in our space and how serving different cultures and people from different backgrounds is extremely important. All right, so David&#8217;s question was, what are the dates for WordCamp next year? Do we have any idea?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, I think we know them. I&#8217;ll put them out later. They&#8217;ll be in a blog post or something.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Okay, he will be disappointed again.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well just, I don&#8217;t know if I could tell you the day of the week of my birthday or something. I&#8217;m pretty bad at dates.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: No, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: As you might guess from-</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Is it going to be in December again, though?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I believe so. Don&#8217;t hold me to anything there. I will officially find something.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: But late in the year still.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, yeah, so I think that we&#8217;ll put up like a placeholder site for 2019, and there will definitely be some tweets and some official stuff saying the dates.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Okay.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But to your earlier point, I actually feel what you just described of going between countries in Europe, I feel that when I&#8217;m, excuse me, on the East Coast of America because I can actually drive eight or 10 hours and still be in Texas. I can drive two hours over here and cross through three different states. And that was one of the points that I tried to make. This was actually I think one of my weaker Q&amp;As. I had two answers that were two of the worst answers I&#8217;ve given probably the past few years, and one was what people heard me say, which I wasn&#8217;t trying to say, to Morton&#8217;s thing.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Which I was trying to make the point that in a distributed organization or where we have people working across things, you can read into someone&#8217;s language and it might not be their first language, so it&#8217;s really good to give the benefit of the doubt and realize that we&#8217;re not all speaking our native tongue. And so things might come across as harsh or worse or rude or things, when it&#8217;s just not at all. It&#8217;s certainly not the intention of the person to communicate that way. And the other was the answer, I think it was Birgit&#8217;s question about being hired to work on things.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, corporate sponsorship for WordPress work.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, neither &#8230; I think my brain was just a little fried by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So what would you adjust in terms of, I think that question was around how to &#8230; I was actually with you with Morton, that I didn&#8217;t notice the issue. It seemed like you were pretty clearly speaking about broader communication things, not specifically with his communication, which is-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I would never make fun of Morton&#8217;s or anyone&#8217;s skills speaking another language.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and that one was pretty clear to me. But the one about corporate sponsorship, do you think there&#8217;s a place for &#8230; How do you encourage independent work on the WordPress community, nonprofit side of things? Is there a place or a way that that can be done without corporate sponsorship? Because I know, I mean I&#8217;m self-employed and I can personally understand if I suddenly gave 10 or 20 hours a week or whatever amount of time to the core project in a non-revenue generating way that would be felt. So is there a way that that can be done, or do you think corporate sponsorship of community work is really the only way to go about it right now?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, let me take a second crack at this one. First and foremost, I never want to downplay the contributions of people doing it in their spare time.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and it is, I mean it&#8217;s astonishing and I could be that person, too. I don&#8217;t choose to be that person in this stage of my life, but yeah, it&#8217;s amazing what people are doing completely outside of work time.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, and I also don&#8217;t want to understate how big an impact on the WordPress project, two to four hours a week out of the 168 can have a really huge impact on some big areas. Even a single hour a week, if put in the right place, can move mountains. And WordPress was largely built by volunteers and people doing it in their spare time, and I worry to say, to ever get to a point where we&#8217;re saying we only value people who are doing it full time, or it&#8217;s only possible to make a change if you&#8217;re doing it full time. So that&#8217;s one point I was trying to make, that let&#8217;s never downplay the value that people can do with just a little bit of contributions. Five for the Future is just two hours a week in a work week, right?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Right, yeah, and that was the question [Daniel Bock Huber 00:24:12] had was if you had plans or iterations that you thought would be good for Five for the Future?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, for sure. The second is that the WordPress Foundation is not designed to be an employment entity. Now, there&#8217;s no employees. There&#8217;s no HR. There&#8217;s no benefits. There&#8217;s no payroll. There&#8217;s no anything, and going from zero to one there is actually a pretty big thing. It is designed to give grants. We can give money to other organizations. By the way, I think that there&#8217;s also a big opportunity for other nonprofits to be part of this. There&#8217;s no reason to say only for-profit corporations can sponsor people that work on WordPress. I would love to see more nonprofits that by the way have a lot more expertise in some of the areas that we want more contributions in, including design, accessibility, privacy, internationalization.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: These things, there&#8217;s full nonprofits dedicated to that have often sometimes very large staffs and pretty large budgets, journalism. These I think are really fruitful areas, and in fact one of the things that, I don&#8217;t know if you saw Morton&#8217;s talk, a lot of people I thought misread it. Maybe I misread it as well. When he was talking about open governance, my take was that he was talking about getting WordPress a seat at the table, and discussing these regulation changes and et cetera happening. I think the example last year was, there was this meeting at 10 Downing Street. Who was there? Was WordPress represented?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And he started talking about the Web Foundation, and I began thinking. I was like, &#8220;Wow, well, WordPress only represents a third of Websites, and not even, really. It&#8217;s a third of the top 10 million. Another foundation like the Web Foundation actually might be a better vehicle to try to advocate on the open Web as a whole, versus just the people who happen to be using a single CMS.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and I don&#8217;t want to speak for him in terms of which audience he was trying to, or which group he was trying to represent in terms of within WordPress, or WordPress within the broader Web. I do think that there are often questions about governance of WordPress. You have long been the central vision of the project, and then delegated the execution of that vision to many other people who then lead this project, which is massive at this point. One of the things I&#8217;ve always asked you for several years now was, how many people do you have directly reporting to you?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Because one of the things I find to be important is under this model, where your vision is required, then if you&#8217;re spread out so thin it requires these sprints to focus towards WordPress, rather than always being able to have kind of a constant flow, even if it&#8217;s a minority of your time, going towards that, establishing that vision for WordPress. So, how have you evolved in that regard? I know you&#8217;re-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: What was the number last time you asked me?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It was high.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: What is high? There was one point it was like 26 or something.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, it was in the 20s. It was in the 20s last year I think when we talked about it.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, it&#8217;s under half that now.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: That&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: So, that&#8217;s been really good. There&#8217;s been a lot more leaders, but I would actually argue the point that WordPress has always been sort of my vision being set, or even my direct leadership. There was a good four or five years there where the leadership structure, because we&#8217;ve experimented with lots of different, we don&#8217;t call it governance, but essentially leadership structures in WordPress. For a while, we had kind of the &#8230; It wasn&#8217;t a committee approach, but essentially like the lead developers consensus approach. We did that for a few years.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Even from the beginning it wasn&#8217;t just me. It was me and Mike Little, so it&#8217;s never been solo. Then we went to where the release lead was the final decider, including over me, so that was probably, I don&#8217;t know, 3.9 to 4.7 maybe, that including could overrule me as project lead for what was in the release or not, and that was to try to give a little more autonomy and flexibility to release leads. But the big change was a few years ago I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to take back over core WordPress development,&#8221; and that was to try to provide a &#8230; Try to make some of these big changes happen. So right now it is much more of a benevolent dictator model, although both of those words are questionable. But, I don&#8217;t see that as the permanent forever structure, you know? [crosstalk 00:28:54]-</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: One problem with that is-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I don&#8217;t know if I can sustain this forever. I mean, this is a pretty intense period and we&#8217;re doing some pretty intense work, and I&#8217;ll need a break at some point, too.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and how do you, or do you think there&#8217;s merit in opening that up in some way to certainly have more community input, but sometimes that&#8217;s not good, you know? Sometimes the central vision idea can be more productive, but when you bring that into open source software versus running a company, maybe there&#8217;s different consequences. So have you given any thought to what does WordPress look like after this phase in terms of a governance structure?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s hard, because I haven&#8217;t seen any models where anything resembling voting works, you know?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, for running software, you mean.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, and for choosing a direction. It&#8217;s not that many models for consumer-facing software. There&#8217;s some for server-facing software, where sort of like a committee approach works, you know? It seldom creates great user experiences. You kind of want, I&#8217;m not saying it always has to be me, but what I want is a strong, opinionated, thoughtful leader doing, setting a bold direction, taking experiments and being willing to fail, comfortable with failure, is I think what you need to create great software.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So how do you-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And that&#8217;s tough, and by the way, we&#8217;ve had lots of those leaders in the history of WordPress, and I think that&#8217;s been the success. It&#8217;s not just because I&#8217;m doing anything.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Sure.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s that we have lots of folks and we have, as a community including myself, invested that authority and power in them, and that trust. It doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s always been right, like we&#8217;ve definitely done things that we might undo later or that were mistakes, but the ability to make those mistakes is what you need for an innovative organization. When you look at any organization, private or public, it&#8217;s too afraid to fail, that&#8217;s when you get this kind of incrementalism. That&#8217;s when you get this kind of fear of change. That&#8217;s when you essentially stagnate, and if you were to point to any place that software goes poorly, whether that&#8217;s in government or companies that don&#8217;t innovate or get disrupted by smaller upstarts, anything, it&#8217;s because one of those happened or probably all of those things happened. They got too successful and then they were afraid to fail, because it was too embarrassing and they had too much to lose, and then they stagnate.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: All right, we&#8217;re here to take a quick break and I want to thank our partner, iThemes, long-time supporter of Post Status. I&#8217;ve got Cory Miller on with me to talk about what they&#8217;ve got going on. Hey, Cory.</p>\n<p>Cory Miller: Hey, Brian, thanks for having me on.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, it&#8217;s my pleasure and I appreciate your support over the years. I was hoping that you could just tell me maybe what&#8217;s a big success iThemes had in 2018, and what you&#8217;re looking forward to next year?</p>\n<p>Cory Miller: Yeah, as you know in January of 2018 now we were acquired. iThemes was acquired by a great hosting company named Liquid Web, so this year has been spent integrating. We are almost done with the first round of integrations for our key product, iTheme Sync, which promotes site management for freelancers and agency WordPress Websites, BackupBuddy, our long-time popular plugin, and securities. So we&#8217;re almost done with the final round of that. You know in any transition there&#8217;s always bumps, but it&#8217;s been a really good ride so far.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, have you been getting good feedback from LiquidWeb customers so far, or I guess are you looking forward to seeing iThemes products more integrated with LiquidWeb&#8217;s stuff?</p>\n<p>Cory Miller: Very much so. We saw hosting as the future for WordPress. All of the big hosting companies making significant investments in WordPress, and this was a way to join forces with a great hosting company and for our products, our team, to live on into the future doing really good things in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Cool, and iThemes products are still available outside of LiquidWeb as well. You can use them on any host that you choose, or a naked VPS if you want help managing a server that you want to pull all the lever, you can still do that but you can use all the iThemes tools to help you manage the day, and [inaudible 00:33:31] out of your WordPress Website. I&#8217;m really excited for you guys and what you have going on, and look forward to hearing more as next year comes along. Thanks for being on real quick, and if people want to learn more about what you&#8217;ve got going on, where do they go?</p>\n<p>Cory Miller: iThemes.com, best place to click some links and see if we are offering something that you&#8217;re in need of. We&#8217;d be happy to serve you.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Awesome, well, thanks for being such a big part of the WordPress community these last 10 years plus, and a partner of Post Status for as long as Post Status has existed.</p>\n<p>Cory Miller: Yeah, we love Post Status. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing, Brian. Thank you.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Thanks, buddy. Bye. We&#8217;ve got another question from Ant in regards to giving people a seat at the table in a governance structure, which was seeking an update on the growth council, whether that was productive this last year, whether it happened. How can it happen going forward? I don&#8217;t know anything about what&#8217;s happened in the last year, so what have you learned there, and what&#8217;s happened?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, so we created these two growth councils, one consumer one and one enterprise one, and we did these monthly meetings, video chats. And my goal with creating it was one, to bring some people together, so there are direct competitors in these meetings. It&#8217;s enterprise agencies that are bidding on the same clients. It&#8217;s Web posts that are advertising on the same key words and everything. And so you&#8217;d have like that as part of the discussion, and one of the goals also was to produce, improve essentially the WordPress experience.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Some parts were successful, some parts weren&#8217;t, so I was amazed and humbled by how people came together. I think it really showed something I&#8217;ve tried to demonstrate with Automatic in the past, that you can both compete and work together for a greater good. People were both able, because it was a safe space, they were able to share things that were going on in their companies, things they were hearing from clients that they couldn&#8217;t talk about publicly, things they were seeing, experiences, in a safe space that generated some amazing discussions. I&#8217;ll also say selfishly that I learned a ton being part of these meetings, so it was really, really valuable for me.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: And that&#8217;s about how their organizations work and what&#8217;s important to them, or what kind of stuff?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And the people they&#8217;re talking to, whether that&#8217;s consumers, kind of the more mass market side particularly with Web posts, but also with people doing trainings, people building small Websites, which is my kind of mental model was like, if it&#8217;s people spending under $100,000 a year for a site that&#8217;s the consumer group. If it&#8217;s over $100,000 a year, that&#8217;s the enterprise group. Not exact, but that was kind of like a rough mental model. And on the enterprise side, what are they seeing? It was so interesting as well, like most of the big agencies started building sites with Gutenberg kind of like February, March, and were launching them over the summer. Now at this point, they&#8217;re basically building everything. They&#8217;ve been building everything new with Gutenberg for the better part of a year.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I actually spoke with Tom Wilmot from Human Made and Jake Goldman from 10up both, and they&#8217;ve both expressed that they had an early embrace of Gutenberg and seen success with it. Somebody was telling me, I think it might have been Tom, that they showed off a demo of Gutenberg and instantly blew some Adobe experience manager style feature out of the water. Some company had spent gargantuan sums of money on the alternative experience, and they did a couple customizations with Gutenberg over the course of a couple weeks and showed them this as a prototype. It was already far superior to what their competition was putting forward, so from those-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: There&#8217;s got to be so much of that.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: At Gutenberg, people have written bad versions of what Gutenberg is, including myself, for five years now. And now we&#8217;ve got this standard we can all build on. I actually had it right here. Human Made had this really cool white paper. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen this.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Nice, yeah, they printed it.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s glossy, it&#8217;s pretty &#8230; I mean, these are the types of things that for enterprises are really important. PDFs, white papers, case studies, and enterprise section of WordPress.org, important for that user group. For a consumer, a lot of things that that team talked about was the importance of talking about different use cases and allowing users to self-segment over the job they want to get done, and having some guides for that, some recommended plugins, essentially hand-holding them through the process of it.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: So I talked about what was successful about the councils. I&#8217;ll tell you what didn&#8217;t go as I hoped, producing things. I think because it was all often the CEOs of their companies or kind of the head folks, it was difficult for them to get time other than the meetings, in between the meetings, to just do work to produce for example a new enterprise section of WordPress.org. So actually on Saturday morning, I officially dissolved the councils.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Okay.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: What I told the folks was, we&#8217;re not going to schedule out these meetings for the rest of the year. I left the Slack channels up so people could keep chatting if they want, and of course I said if anyone wants to keep meeting on their own, they&#8217;re happy to, or to continue the projects, and both groups said they would like to. The enterprise group wants to get the enterprise subsection of WordPress.org out. The consumer group wants to continue shipping some things, but it was a year and we didn&#8217;t ship these things, that honestly probably any &#8230; It could have happened within a month or two if it had had a lot of focus from any of the people involved. It illustrated to me actually the difficulty of a committee approach.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, it makes me think of-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: One of the things that came up was the enterprise. We did drinks on Saturday as a kind of ending thing. It was a combined consumer and enterprise, and one of the things is they were like, &#8220;Hey, if you had just chosen one person to be in charge of this, that person could have said, &#8216;You do this, you do this, you do this,&#8217; it would have shipped probably pretty quickly.&#8221; But because no one knew who was in charge and who could tell other people to do things, I think it was Jake who said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I can tell Tom, &#8216;You need to finish this page,&#8217; or &#8216;You didn&#8217;t edit it.\'&#8221; Who&#8217;s in charge? And so that&#8217;s I think unintentionally illustrated an alternative group and management style that, because if it wasn&#8217;t adjusted and set up correctly, which is my responsibility, my fault, and not getting the results that we wanted. So, great experiment though, and I&#8217;m really, really glad we did it.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I wonder, you see movies or you see a senate hearing or something, and you have the primary people at the center table and then you have all their deputies on the outside. They&#8217;re still in a safe space, but they&#8217;re the people that actually go out and do things afterwards. It&#8217;s not like the senator or the CEO on that council necessarily that&#8217;s implementing, but they bring other people from their organization in to help the implementation component.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I was kind of hoping more of that would happen. It&#8217;s true, some people on the councils were contributing individually, and some lead larger organizations so they can shepherd a lot of resources as well. So, I think there&#8217;s some of both that&#8217;s needed in the WordPress world. Yoast and myself are probably good examples, Yoast the person, not the company, of a leader who&#8217;s really passionate about areas, who also brings along a lot of their company to work on it.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, they have a lot of manpower there.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: That they&#8217;ve got dedicated to core.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Person power.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Person power, thank you.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yoast had an incredible effect on Gutenberg and the 5.0 release, even though they&#8217;re smaller than all of the hosts, all of everything else. I think it&#8217;s a great example of Five for the Future.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So I have one more process question, and then I want to dig into phases two through four, but Darren Ethier I think is how I pronounce his last name, he asked what were your thoughts process-wise on using GitHub for probably the most ambitious-sized project yet with WordPress from a feature plugin or feature point of view? Do you think it was encouraging enough to potentially start moving off track in SVN? I do know there was a make WordPress post that was about this, but I&#8217;m curious your personal experience, whether you liked being in GitHub day to day or using Git in the process, or if you missed track in terms of that development?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I mean, I&#8217;m an early adopter of GitHub. My user name is literally the letter M, to show you how early it was, and I really like it. I think it&#8217;s a great product. Having kind of a parallel process, where I&#8217;ve now been involved pretty heavily in something on TRACK, involved pretty heavily on something on GitHub, there&#8217;s pluses and minuses. I wouldn&#8217;t say either is a panacea. The thing that actually makes the real difference is much more your engineering management. It&#8217;s your triage. It&#8217;s your process. It&#8217;s the testing. On both GitHub and TRACK, we made mistakes and had tickets that sat for weeks without anyone responding to them.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That doesn&#8217;t have to do with the software. It has to do with the people, and I do worry the distraction of effort and time that switching source control and issue trackers and just also all the work that needs to be done to migrate all the tooling at the same time, if it would distract us from what&#8217;s actually most important in 2019, which is to tighten up some of our loose parts of the software. So that&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;m hesitant to commit to saying that we&#8217;re going to do anything, particularly in 2019.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Also, I am a big fan of GitLab, obviously. I see a lot of, I noticed a lot of comments on Helen&#8217;s post for actually advocating for GitLab. All of these things are getting better pretty rapidly. GitHub was slow for a while, and now they&#8217;re really picking it up. Time is kind of on our side if we switch later, because whatever we switch to will be six or 12 months better than it is today, and probably provide perhaps more of a compelling step function and user experience than is currently there, which is yes, I totally agree the interfaces are more modern and there&#8217;s better tools, and I do strongly prefer Git for branching and all these other things. There&#8217;s almost nothing you could tell me about either way that is an argument I haven&#8217;t heard or made myself. But it&#8217;s more just about a community focus thing, and what is the issues most urgently impacting WordPress users, both current and potential, today?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I like what you say there in terms of the urgency factor, because I think I agree with you. Personally, if I were to do something to try to actually make code changes in SVN, I would always have to go remind myself, how do I patch something, and do I have the tools on my modern MacBook to do so? Whereas by &#8230; Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I was just going to say, we&#8217;ve built a lot of bridges between them as well. WordPress is synced to Git. You can do things both ways. We have tools for migrating patches between them. We&#8217;ve got official GitHub for WordPress. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff out there, but there is a point when I really want to focus on the developer experience and really invest some serious, serious time into that, but we&#8217;ve got to get the user experience right first.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I think I&#8217;m with you in terms of that priority, but long-term bringing on new people to be comfortable developing on the software, most people in their day to day are in GitHub or in Git more broadly, so even the self-hosted Git version or GitFlow I think in the long run would be good, but I like what you said there about the urgency component.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, that&#8217;s one of the things I was looking at a lot, because that is one of the I think better arguments for using something centralized like GitHub, is that a lot of people have GitHub accounts.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Basically there was a while, I&#8217;ve reviewed probably over 10,000 engineering applications for Automatic. Every single one of them has a GitHub link. There&#8217;s definitely something to be said for that. I didn&#8217;t notice that big a difference in type or number of contributions, so it is a barrier to entry to make a WordPress.org account. It doesn&#8217;t appear to be the most salient factor in determining whether people submit patches or are active in TRACK or not-</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Interesting.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Active in [inaudible 00:46:57] TRACK or not.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I&#8217;d be curious how that ends up working if it was officially there, but nevertheless let&#8217;s move on to-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, just look at the numbers, because Gutenberg was as official as anything, and the numbers of contributors to that versus the number of contributors that we have in any given core release, kind of similar. I think that the hard part is actually deciding that you&#8217;re going to dive into the code. The hard part is saying like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take this code. I&#8217;m going to figure out the problem and then submit the patch.&#8221; And once you&#8217;ve been through that, making an account one place or another, I think it&#8217;s probably something you&#8217;ll do one way or another.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So phase one of Gutenberg mostly complete, or at least out the door, and you&#8217;re going to be iterating on this every two weeks like you told me before. Let&#8217;s talk about phase two through four, and let&#8217;s start with just why do you think that the order that you established things in is the right order? Why do you think this is the right direction, I guess, overall?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, some of it is sequential and some of it is not. Are you familiar with the Kubler Ross Five Stages of Grief?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: No, I&#8217;m not.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s like anger, denial, depression, acceptance. You&#8217;ve probably seen these before.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen this in terms of markets. It&#8217;s the same stages of grief are identified in market cycles, so like in the stock market it&#8217;s a very similar thing, but I didn&#8217;t know it was called that.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I don&#8217;t have one on my desk, but I actually have some glasses that I often use for drinks that have little markers on them, and it actually has the five stages.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Nice.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: We could put that in the show notes for the podcast, a link to those.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: A common misperception, I ended up actually reading one of her books called On Grief and Grieving, and it was actually finished posthumously, so she actually passed away in the process of it. This is I think Elizabeth Kubler Ross, or I forget the exact name, but amazing book. Good to read even if you&#8217;re not going to go through grief or grieving, because we all do at some point. One of the most fascinating things I took from that book was people think of those stages as sequential, and actually they can happen out of order, and they can happen simultaneously. In fact, you can go through anger and denial and acceptance and everything all in the same kind of 10-minute period.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That was a really fascinating insight to me just of the human condition, because we are often more complex and less sequential than sometimes our simplified systems would like to say, or we&#8217;d like to think. Development is the same way. Phase one is not stopping where phase two is starting, and I think bits of phases one through four have already happened and will continue to happen as we go through it. It&#8217;s just more about priorities. We&#8217;ve gotten the editor experience to the point where I think it&#8217;s pretty darn decent, especially for new users. Now people, if you look at people who started using WordPress in a post-Gutenberg world, of which there are now hundreds of thousands, so they&#8217;ve only known Gutenberg. This is that example of the support person who said, &#8220;Bring me back the simple editor,&#8221; and they meant Gutenberg?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: What is the new barrier that they&#8217;re running into? What&#8217;s the new wall they&#8217;re hitting? It&#8217;s the rest of the site. It&#8217;s customization. It&#8217;s widgets.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So for those that don&#8217;t have these phases locked down in their brain, phase two is customizing outside of the post content itself as the next point of emphasis. So this could be widgets, menus and miscellaneous content. David posted a funny picture on Twitter where you looked like you were in deep thought during the State of the Word and he said, &#8220;I wonder what Matt&#8217;s thinking about right now?&#8221; You said it was probably the process of transporting menus to Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Moving, I feel like this is something that&#8217;s happened every few years [crosstalk 00:51:12] in WordPress, it&#8217;s like the old menu system, then the new menu system, then the customizer menu system. Now we&#8217;re talking about menus here, and also not calling it menus but reshaping to navigation.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And navigation block, I think is probably a good way to put it.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, it seems like we&#8217;ve got some debt in regards to spending time on things that then we don&#8217;t use for a super long time, so how can we do the Gutenberg way of site customization and content and try to be efficient and long-lasting with that effort?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, I mean first we&#8217;ll start doing it in plugins, in the Gutenberg plugin actually, just like we did for the editor. And so we can have, one of the reasons Gutenberg is where it is is because we did do a lot of user testing along the way, and it wasn&#8217;t just testing mock-ups or ideas. We had the actual working plugin on actual working WordPress sites so they could run. That makes a world of difference, so we&#8217;ll be able to do that for the customize, replacing widgets.PHP, piece of cake. That&#8217;s just taking over the page. The customizer is a little trickier, but we can do it because all of Gutenberg was designed to be responsive.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Essentially, the customizer side bar is very similar to a mobile view, a narrow screen. It&#8217;s kind of like instead of a wide version, it&#8217;s a narrow version of that interface, so I think we can slip in there. Mainly it just requires a lot of rethinking, and there are some tough concepts that currently blocks don&#8217;t have, like the idea of widget visibility, which is [crosstalk 00:52:49].</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I was about to say conditionality, or like show it here but not there. That&#8217;s one of the experiences that seems like it could get really confusing, because someone&#8217;s on a post and they change a sidebar, and therefore they think they changed it just there but they changed it everywhere, vice-versa. There&#8217;s a lot of UX things that seem like they could get complicated.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, so we&#8217;ve got to figure that out, to be honest. I don&#8217;t have the answer right now. We&#8217;ve got to experiment and test our way into what works there, because there are some powerful and complex concepts that I think we can maintain, but just make a lot more intuitive and also make not so in people&#8217;s face. So if they don&#8217;t need to have widgets or blocks that only show up on the sidebar of search pages, it&#8217;s not kind of in their face and making them think about things. It&#8217;s that whole thing, making it more powerful and more intuitive at the same time.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But currently, blocks don&#8217;t have a concept of that, but if we solve it for sidebars, widget areas, whatever you want to call it, perhaps we could solve that for blocks everywhere they&#8217;re used. Showing different headers on different pages is not something that is currently supported by most themes on different types of templates, but why not? That would actually be pretty cool, different footers on different types of pages. I could easily imagine different types of sites that would do this.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It also raised a good point, which is kind of what has always been one of my bugaboos about front end editing, is that when I&#8217;m writing, I want to focus. I don&#8217;t want to see my header and footer and sidebar and all this other stuff, much less edit them. I think, I mean I&#8217;ve always talked about zooming in and zooming out, Gutenberg essentially being like a new 3D interface for WordPress. I think we want to make it very easy to kind of zoom in and out, including focus on one single area or even one single block, if you really want to work within that.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: And that means in some ways potentially front end editing too, right? When I think about Gutenberg, the one beef I have with writing in WordPress is all the other stuff beyond the editor. Whether it&#8217;s TinyMCE or Gutenberg, I write mostly text and a few images. I&#8217;m not doing a lot of page layout, and I love the tools that Gutenberg&#8217;s brought in. For instance, you brought up some of Nick Hamze&#8217;s blocks. I talk to Nick sometimes, and he&#8217;s got so much creativity and I love that it empowers that. But for 90% of the things I&#8217;m going to do, I&#8217;m just writing. A clear, focused writing area is what I like, so I actually just don&#8217;t like the fact that I can go into the appearance editor and the plug in screen. Those are all one click away, rather than just saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the page.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: The best Gutenberg interact I&#8217;ve had yet was actually WordPress.org/Gutenberg, because I was experiencing Gutenberg. It&#8217;s a live demo of Gutenberg. I was able to experience Gutenberg, and none of the other stuff was there. It was just a column of content, and I really enjoyed that, so is that a part, a way that you think we can focus on how to get to writing and not worrying about everything else?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: We can support both. I mean, you currently have a version of this in Gutenberg where it can show the menu or not, or you can go to the mode which is my preference mode, where Gutenberg takes over the whole screen so you don&#8217;t have a sidebar menu there, even minimized. I actually strongly prefer that.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: See, I didn&#8217;t even know that. I&#8217;ve missed that.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, yeah, yeah, so go in Gutenberg to the top right, the dots. I&#8217;m trying to think exactly where it is. Are you opening your WordPress as well?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I am.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: We&#8217;ll go through this together.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I might take over my screen share here, but that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh yeah, do you want me to screen share?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: No, I mean I&#8217;m recording us.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Oh, got you, got you.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So people, this might end up on YouTube or something.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: So in the three dots, there is three kind of options there.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Tool bar, spotlight mode and full screen mode. I actually am in full screen mode. I strongly, strongly prefer it.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Neat.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Top tool bar I don&#8217;t think is that useful, but they know that. This was basically, there was a huge kind of fight earlier. If you look at Yoast&#8217;s original post about the plan for Gutenberg, there alternative UI is basically all about the top tool bar. Then spotlight mode I also don&#8217;t love, but some people really like it. It kind of grays out the other blocks and then makes the current block you&#8217;re in more visually prominent.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Cool, and for anyone that happens to be watching this, I just popped it up onto the screen where you can see exactly where that is, so that&#8217;s really cool. I learn new things every day.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, and so even this menu, like I&#8217;m looking at this menu right now. Do you have it open?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I do.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I want to talk through some things that could be really improved here. So for example, originally we didn&#8217;t have this descriptive text under each of these three views.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well one, the text should be views, not view, and I think that there is, we can improve that text. Under editor, I don&#8217;t know if visual versus code is actually very intuitive, and two, under code editor, I think it&#8217;s a beautiful place to expose that you can actually go into the code editor on a per-block basis, so just a little bit of text there that says, &#8220;Hey, also per block you can go into this.&#8221; Manageable reusable blocks needs the square and the little pointy thing that shows that that&#8217;s going to take you out of Gutenberg, and I think it does open a new window.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And I think that we should put some sort of star or cool icon next to keyboard shortcuts, because once you learn those, you are off to the races. So just a good example that as far as we&#8217;ve come with Gutenberg, you can look at a single screen and immediately think of four or five things that are very improvable and that are certainly worth testing and getting out there.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, that&#8217;s neat.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I always joke I&#8217;m the unhappiest WordPress user in the world. It&#8217;s hard for me to look at anything in WordPress and not see all the things that could be made better, and just be terribly impatient to get them better as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So, speaking of impatient, you&#8217;re going to have to &#8230; Well, you might be able to work on some of these things at the same time but also there is a phase, a priority, and number three was about collaborative editing. For me, I think of this not even necessarily like me and you might collaborate on a post, but sometimes I want to collaborate with myself. My favorite tool from Automatic that you guys have built is probably Simplenote, because it&#8217;s like the only to-do app-ish thing, and it&#8217;s very unstructured, but it&#8217;s the only to-do app type of thing that I&#8217;ve ever really used in depth, because it&#8217;s really easy to open. It&#8217;s really easy to start writing, and it&#8217;s instantly on my phone. So for me, collaborative editing in some ways is just this simple process back and forth.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Across devices.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, across devices.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Totally.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Because I do a lot of stuff through my phone, but your collaborative editing is much more than just cross-device. It&#8217;s also cross-individual, and people building things together. Why do you think that&#8217;s an important thing to be in core WordPress experiences?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Hmm, that&#8217;s a good example of something that there&#8217;s not a bajillion people asking for right now. But just like post revisions, which is one of my favorite things I&#8217;ve forced to be in WordPress that I think is really fundamental to have the entire system works, this-</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, a lot of people have been saved by revisions.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, I think this idea that when you&#8217;re editing in a post, the post is almost like an object and people from different devices, different things, can all come and be simultaneously working on that same object, is a mental model that is technically extraordinarily difficult. But if you get it right, it&#8217;s just a magical user experience. Even simple stuff, like do you remember when Netflix started saving where you&#8217;d watched up to across devices?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah, that&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Magical, and it&#8217;s so simple.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I use that a good bit. We use that a good bit with our son, because the easiest way for him to be happy in a car is to have somebody&#8217;s phone. You can pull up Super Wings or whatever, right where he left off, so yeah, I do agree. And even when Google Docs came out with that, it was revolutionary in a way but people didn&#8217;t realize how much it would transform the way they write documents, so &#8230;</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Totally, and we&#8217;ve got, the Web now supports technologies like WebRTC, that will perhaps enable us to do this even without centralized service, which is super cool, too. Because before, I was &#8230; Conspiracy theorists won&#8217;t believe this but I was actually really disappointed that it looked like the only way we could do this was in Jetpack. Now, it looks like we&#8217;ll actually be able to do this in a much more distributed fashion.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Interesting. Funny enough, I didn&#8217;t even think about that conspiracy theory and everything. As delightful as that sounds to think about, I didn&#8217;t consider the centralization aspect of it.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, so it&#8217;s definitely, there&#8217;s some stuff out there that&#8217;s possible. By the way, there might still be something where Jetpack can enhance it, or maybe we use Simperium, which is the engine behind Simplenote, to do something even fancier, but we can do a lot without that. But this also requires us to rethink our user flows around what versions, what it means to edit something. Because right now, you and I can kind of be on different paths, and we can save each other and merge over each other. And what is the relationship between what&#8217;s on the edit screen versus what&#8217;s live? That also is going to apply now to the entire site, so maybe what you and I are working on together is the new version of Post Status, and you&#8217;re changing the typography and I&#8217;m moving the widgets around and things like that, and then we&#8217;re setting that to go live at 12:00 pm on a Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, that&#8217;s really cool. Another element of that that is a quirk in WordPress I guess, but you could publish a post and now I want to update it, but I don&#8217;t want to update it right now, but I want to save what I&#8217;ve updated.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Right now it&#8217;s either, it&#8217;s all about your current session. Once it&#8217;s published, you either update it or those changes are basically gone. You don&#8217;t kind of save a draft of an update, so a work flow like this would inherently basically have to solve a problem like that, so that would be nice.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Basically, we&#8217;re going to reimplement Git in the post-content table, in the WP Post table.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, that sounds like no problem.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Piece of cake.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, on that note, do you think there are underlying architectural changes that WordPress is going to have to go through to enable both this experience, because this is Gutenberg, but also I mean you&#8217;re probably faced with some of the problems that a tool like WooCommerce has in terms of scalability and being the right tool for the job for that next level of application. These aren&#8217;t blogs anymore, but we basically have the same data base, the same data base structure. You can extend it. You can change things, but do you think there&#8217;s rethinking that needs to be done in that regard?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Sure, and I actually think that [inaudible 01:04:12] is I think we have the opportunity to readdress and in a very backwards compatible way provide a path for people to upgrade some data structures, some things that have been hanging around for a while. An obvious one is widgets are a serialized array. Now we can move that to being JSON. There&#8217;s the native structure, data structure that Gutenberg uses behind the scenes. For some reason, we have to store this as like HTML plus comments, we can just store it in the native data format, which is pretty cool.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: By the way, as we increase the MySQL version, we can actually query and get things out as JSON objects directly from MySQL. We don&#8217;t have to take them in and out of strings, so there&#8217;s just some clean-up, some fun stuff we can do. When we get higher PHP versions, we can name spacing doing different things. J-Trip&#8217;s been talking about doing some pretty cool composer stuff. All of this is, we&#8217;re getting the user part back on track and so that also means we can start to invest a lot more in that developer experience, which I think is crucial. Also I feel, I have a ton of empathy for, I actually for better or worse, I interact every day a lot more with developers than I do with users, so I really try to get out of my way to interact with users, but you can imagine the gripes and pains of developers is something that is more of my daily experience.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So we&#8217;ll have time to talk about all these phases over the next few years, but quickly what do you see in terms of the number of sites where having a multilingual setup, and this is around the focus of phase four, how often are you encountering Websites like that, and how much do you think that this being a part of the WordPress experience would be empowering for people to actually support more languages and more language versions of their site?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I think it would be a really big fundamental concept. The Web is global. English or single language is actually I think a small minority. People who speak one language is a small minority of the seven billion people in the world. This is obviously very prevalent in places like Quebec, where there&#8217;s officially French and English, and of course all over Europe. This is why I get the question every year for Camp Europe. I am monolingual, ashamedly so.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But the world is polyglots, and that&#8217;s why I named the mailing list WP Polyglots, not WP translate or WP anything, when I set that up almost 15 years ago now. Even for monolinguists like me, I got someone contacted me the other day saying, &#8220;Hey, can I translate this Gutenberg FAQ into Japanese? Do I have your permission to?&#8221; And they put it on a different site. How cool would it have been if I just could have said, &#8220;Hey, by the way, collaboration and work flow, here, you now have access to make this post into Japanese,&#8221; and now at the top it&#8217;ll have a little link to it, to the Japanese version, and there will be sort of a neural structure in a canonical place for the MA.TT version of the Gutenberg FAQ translated to Japanese by this volunteer, where anyone in the world could live. And by the way-</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I was about to say, what if it was permissionless, like just if someone wants to make something on my site in other languages, do it. As small as Post Status is, I&#8217;ve had people that want to recreate the members side in Dutch or something.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Cool.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I&#8217;m like, I can&#8217;t do that, but that sounds amazing if you want to do that. But I&#8217;d be totally down if the structure was there for it to say, translate this post, and it&#8217;s almost like forking software, or almost the way language packs and plugins work. You don&#8217;t have to be responsible for every language pack if you&#8217;re the plug in author. Someone can just come and do it, and I think that&#8217;d be really cool for posts.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That would be so cool, and by the way, layer that in with other plugins. Layer that in with membership, so you only allow members to translate things, or layer that in with one I&#8217;d love to re-evaluate which is [Blickey 01:08:23]. So there is public revision history and sort of moderated submissions, so maybe I have, maybe my colleague [Nalco 01:08:34] can moderate Japanese translations, but maybe she doesn&#8217;t have time to translate every single one of my posts herself. But when people submit one, she could take a few minutes to just read it through and make sure they&#8217;re not having [crosstalk 01:08:47].</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, translate my post and make it sound completely different.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s actually WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Assuming good intent is part of the thing there.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Do you remember the Happy Birthday incident?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Someone, because when we opened up kind of like more totally community translations on WordPress.com and made it easy for anyone to do it, someone changed where it said comments, like leave a comment, into Happy Birthday! I forget what language it was, Italian, so all Italian sites under every single post would say Happy Birthday!</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Just Happy Birthday!</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Which I think is kind of like the most brilliant, if you&#8217;re going to troll or vandalize us, that was a really lovely way to do it.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, we could probably learn some things from Wikipedia&#8217;s own editorial flows and how to implement something like that. I do think that would be really neat. Do you think that still leaves room for other plugins that are doing various multilingual things? Does it leave room for them, or do you think it kind of eats them up and makes that business model go away? Because there&#8217;s been some good-sized businesses in that realm.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It leaves room for them 100%. In fact, I think it increases them a ton. Same thing with page builders. If you look at where the business model is for a lot of these translation plugins are going, they&#8217;re actually helping you do the translation. That makes total sense. If I&#8217;m a business, I might want my site in five languages. If I can click a button and just say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll pay you $1,000,&#8221; and by the way the plugins can be in the middle of that or there can sort of be an API for that. I mean, this is kind of incredible, but the downside of them is very similar to page builders, which is each kind of has its own way to do the data and the storage.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Some put it all in post content. Some put it in custom post type. Some put it in meta fields. Some put it in separate tables, so you essentially have actually each of the possible ways you could kind of logically do this exists. So now, if I&#8217;m building a plugin that wants to work with multilingual versions of the site, how do I do it? There&#8217;s no common foundation. Exact same issue we had with blocks. There were blocks on WordPress for years now, but every single visual composer and Beaver Builder and Elementor and Avada and Divi, they all did blocks in a different way.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Matt, there&#8217;s like 100 business questions I want to ask you but we&#8217;re over an hour already, so I will-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Can we take a few more minutes, like maybe wrap it in like, say 10?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, sure. If you&#8217;re down, I&#8217;m down.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: You&#8217;re one of my favorite people to talk to.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Well, I appreciate it. I love talking to you as well, and I appreciate your openness.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Between you all, honestly you all and the Tavern folks, these are so much fun. I actually listen to a lot of these podcasts. It&#8217;s really enjoyable for me, so I appreciate you doing it. My ask of you for 2019 is, I&#8217;d love to see a bit most Post Status on the scene, you know?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, that&#8217;s a task for myself as well, so I did a relatively personal update recently.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I saw that.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: One of the things that I&#8217;ve struggled with is I haven&#8217;t been in the thick of things in about four years, so I&#8217;m actually not spoiled, but I&#8217;m doing some part-time work actually being in WordPress, and back into doing stuff.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Cool.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It&#8217;s actually on the product side, not the service side. I&#8217;ve worked in an agency. This is going to give me a chance to do some part-time work on the product in SaaS side of things, so I&#8217;m excited about that. I know from history, when I&#8217;m working hard on something, whether it&#8217;s building my own site or working in the industry, it gives me much more to say, so I&#8217;m excited about being inspired by working within our space more, and within the experience more. Because it&#8217;s been four years of not doing that, and over those years I&#8217;ve tried to rely on other people to have a voice more as I felt like mine was fading. Kind of like what you were saying, you&#8217;re around developers all the time and not, like you want to be around more users. I was looking at the industry a lot, and not being in the industry I felt made it more difficult to have good things to say.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Although I would say the outside perspective is really valuable as well.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, I think at least for a season I need, it&#8217;ll be really beneficial for me.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I can&#8217;t wait to see, and by the way, as a member of the Post Status community, include us along for the ride. I&#8217;m sure after that personal update you got a ton of people contacting you [crosstalk 01:13:14].</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I did, which I was very thankful for.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s one of those things, I think what was beautiful about that is you opened up about the struggle, not just about the good stuff. It&#8217;s really scary to be vulnerable like that, publicly. It was scary of me to put the things we learned and did wrong in the State of the Word, right? I just wanted to talk about all the good stuff, but it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s important for us to talk about what I messed up on. People help when they see that.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, that was very-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And I think the most valuable thing you built is like overall a pretty positive community that cares about WordPress deeply, so that&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, and thank you, and I was very appreciative of the various responses that I got between feedback and ideas and job offers. But I&#8217;m excited to do some work within the space, and you know actually it did give me, it was beneficial because I got my head kind of out of the space a little bit, which I needed. I&#8217;ve been thinking about WordPress a whole lot since 2010, with basically no break, and I can&#8217;t imagine how you feel at times. But for me to still have a focus on WordPress but at least spend part of my week thinking about other things, doing other things, it gave me some personal benefits I think, and allowed me to look at WordPress things with a bigger picture. So I&#8217;m excited for 2019 and I think it&#8217;ll be a lot of fun. Now for you, just-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, I often tell people if you&#8217;re ever feeling not inspired or burnt out, go to a museum. Watch a show. All of my best ideas for WordPress have always come from the intersection of different fields, different areas, and I think that&#8217;s true of most great art, most great software, most great anything. So if you can get out there and keep, the WordPress stuff or whatever you&#8217;re working on will be in the back of your mind anyway, so if you can kind of focus on something else for a little while, actually really it&#8217;s fun.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It is.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I can&#8217;t wait to see what you do. As always, let me know if I can ever be of help.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Well, thank you very much. So a couple of business-y things. One is, what&#8217;s your biggest product right now, from an Automatic perspective? Are you guys seeing a lot of growth in the WooCommerce space, or is dot com still the main revenue driver? What are you seeing there?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Sure, let me just think through what I can say publicly.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: When are you filing your S-1, Matt?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, we make the same joke in Automatic that they made at Apple, which is we&#8217;re a ship that leaks from the top.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Hey, I have to commend you, as someone who doesn&#8217;t like it but I can appreciate that this is the case. You guys are pretty good about being tight-lipped on the leaky boat side of things, so it&#8217;s a tight ship. I don&#8217;t get near as many of the leaks as I would like out of Automatic.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Well, I think a big part of that is just most of what we do is in the open. If you want to see the pricing tests we&#8217;re running on the new blogger and e-commerce plan that we just launched on WordPress.com, it&#8217;s in the Calypso GitHub so you can see which prices we&#8217;re charging which people, and how the test is going, and what percentage it&#8217;s going out to. Kind of, it&#8217;s all out there. WordPress.com is still the largest, and it&#8217;s still growing like a weed. I think in 2018 WooCommerce will actually grow faster in a year over year percentage, which is kind of what I started saying. We&#8217;re starting to see what I predicted when we actually first brought WooCommerce in, which is that the e-commerce opportunity has the potential to be bigger than all of the rest of Automatic&#8217;s businesses combined.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, what&#8217;s Shopify, like eight billion plus market cap, maybe 15? I don&#8217;t know. I think they doubled their size in 2018.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, market cap is just vagaries of the market, but revenue, they&#8217;ll be about a billion dollars this year. So I think it&#8217;s always good to look at kind of, when sort of comparing companies, look at the revenue not just the market cap.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Sure.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: So they&#8217;ll be at a billion dollars and still growing at a really, really good rate. Now, the other reality is that nothing that we do is completely disconnected. A lot of the WooCommerce growth and increasing user experience is sort of amplified, I think, because we&#8217;ve been doing it in Jetpack, which is also amplified by running Jetpack code on WordPress.com and having that sort of stream of new users that are coming there, and so we see the problems that they&#8217;re having, and the struggles, or we build the infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: You asked about data structures earlier. I think one thing that we&#8217;ll start to see a lot more of in WordPress, and actually a very common feature of Jetpack that people don&#8217;t know about, that the Jetpack business plan, you can have full Elasticsearch version of your site. So there are certain use cases for which I don&#8217;t think MySQL is the best medium with which to address or query your data, and Elasticsearch is pretty much the cat&#8217;s meow. So the fact that we can in real time, create real time Elasticsearch indexes for every single Jetpack business site, which only costs $300 per year. Before that, it used to cost &#8230; Actually, I think VIP used to charge $5,000 or $10,000 a year for this, maybe even a couple grand a month, actually. Now we can do it for $300 per year.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Wow.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And that&#8217;s just one of the features in Jetpack Business. That&#8217;s in addition to the real time backup and the activity log and all the other things, the security restores. It just shows that we&#8217;re really surfing the outer edge of Moore&#8217;s Law, and I think that the stuff that we&#8217;re going to be able to do over the next few years is going to be pretty amazing, and I&#8217;m excited about Automatic. We also just moved DNS Perf, we moved back into second place for fastest DNS service, so by the way, way ahead of Amazon, way ahead of Google, and second only to Cloudflare, which Automatic&#8217;s network is tiny but mighty. Cloudflare invests I think over 100 million dollars per year in capex, building out their data centers in their kind of points of presence. We&#8217;ve reached a number two performance ranking with a fraction of that investment, so very proud of that team, very proud of all the folks at Automatic that are really building this out. By the way, then that benefits all the users of Jetpack Photon, the CDN, just so much cool stuff happening.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: That&#8217;s awesome. I heard recently that you all have also been able to lower some of your prices for VIP as you&#8217;re deploying like VIP Go and some of that stuff with scalable Websites. Back when I had my hands in a few VIP sites I think the lowest pricing back then was maybe $3,000 to $4,000 a month, and now you can do it as low as $1,000 a month and you all provide a lot for that, so that&#8217;s impressive.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That sounds about right, yeah. I&#8217;m not up on the latest there, but fundamentally my business philosophy is to get the best stuff in the hands of as many users for as low a price as possible, and we&#8217;re just relentless in kind of cutting the costs, bringing things down, trying to leverage the best and newest technology to do so.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: How are you attacking the very high end, so that a store that may grow up on WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t feel like they have to leave WooCommerce once it hits a certain scale? One of the things that I feel like people have been, I&#8217;ve been hearing from consultants especially, is that they get to a certain size and then they&#8217;re really struggling with WooCommerce, and then something like Shopify ends up being the answer. How is WooCommerce going to compete in that realm to be the platform for Macy&#8217;s or who knows what? Some big company with lots of orders and lots of stuff, so that you can keep them throughout the life cycle?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah, I think my take on that problem, because ultimately what we want to do is be more scalable in Shopify and also a better user experience, and right now I would say they&#8217;re ahead in both. There hasn&#8217;t been as good a feedback loop. The thing that made WordPress so scalable was there was a tight feedback loop between the host, the agencies building the biggest sites, WordPress.com itself being a big site, and the core development. So that meant that when we had bottlenecks, we were able to solve them often in core in ways that were ultra scalable in Webscale.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: WordPress.com is on its own one of the largest sites on the Internet, so that&#8217;s the same software that you can download and use, which is kind of wild. For WooCommerce, that loop isn&#8217;t as strong so one of the things I&#8217;ve been encouraging the team to try to do myself is get a tighter loop between the host and the people building the big sites and the WooCommerce core team, so that they can figure out versus having five different plugins that try to address the scalability in different and often subpar ways, really get that built into core, with the sort of Web scale, knowing everything we&#8217;ve known in 15 years of building WordPress, what&#8217;s going to make it so it can scale to thousands of orders per second, hundreds of millions of rows.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Two more questions, real quick.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: We can do so, by the way. It&#8217;s a very tractable problem. We will solve that. Solving that is something that will happen within the next six to 18 months. Solving the user experience to catch up with Shopify is also improving the user experience, or BigCommerce rather, I think will take longer. That&#8217;s more of a five to 10 year goal.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I personally think that gives both the WordPress ecosystem, the WooCommerce ecosystem and Automatic directly a massive value proposition, if that can be accomplished. I think WordPress now people, you never feel like you have to leave WordPress because you got too big.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: And as that can be accomplished, and that was a massive accomplishment for WordPress. For a long time that wasn&#8217;t true, and now that, if that can be done on the e-commerce side of things, or commerce broadly not just necessarily WooCommerce, I think that will be fantastic for everybody involved.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: By the way, I just want to point that out, just to pause. Think how little, how many other examples of software you can think of that the consumer version also works when you run it at an industrial global scale?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I have no idea. I&#8217;m not very-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s not very common. I think it&#8217;s one of the things the WordPress community should really be proud of, because that is highly unusual. And as we&#8217;re one of the only ultra-successful consumer open source startups, projects, communities, whatever, I think pointing to that sort of scalability is a big thing as well.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So, one question is Automatic has investors. We just saw Slack, Lyft and Uber all file for becoming public companies. When I think, what&#8217;s the option for Automatic, one of however many successful startups where you have investors, they know you&#8217;re a successful startup. They know that there&#8217;s opportunity for them to succeed in that. That&#8217;s long-term revenue stream, remaining a private company. It&#8217;s private equity. It&#8217;s going public, or it&#8217;s acquisition. Do you have any thoughts in terms of what makes you happiest as a company and as a business owner, and what do you think is best for the way Automatic interfaces with the broader WordPress community?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s hard for me to imagine being a public company CEO, any harder than leading an open source project.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I&#8217;ve thought about that a great deal. I think you actually fit the mold for what Wall Street might like in terms of the leader of a public company. I will say, that&#8217;s my bet. My best is one day Automatic would go public, and we figure out how that works in terms of all the private, public components and the open source side of things. But yeah, I&#8217;m curious-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I think it&#8217;s actually a possibility. By the way, I could see other WordPress companies going public, probably WPEngine is the closest to the gates there.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Well good, GoDaddy and EIG are public.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: They are, yeah, so there will be other open source WordPress either based or WordPress will be a part of their business public companies, likely before Automatic as well. I think that&#8217;s a great path for us. Automatic has investors. They are minority investors, so the sort of existential future of the company is in the hand of myself and the other people who own the majority of the shares of Automatic. I think there&#8217;s lots of options. The people you point to, Uber or Lyft, Slack, et cetera, to varying degrees have built some pretty impressive things. I admire some more than others, but also have reached a scale that&#8217;s kind of far beyond where companies generally go public.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Yeah, they really have. It&#8217;s been-</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: What that illustrates is that the private market is actually a lot more liquid and has a lot more capital available for when and how that needs the company or the ecosystem or whatever to grow.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: So I could surmise from that that you don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a rush?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I won&#8217;t even speak to my own personal things, but say just in the industry there&#8217;s less of a rush, so that is the plus and minus of so much capital moving from the public markets into the private markets. So people like Fidelity, T. Rowe Price et cetera that used to only do public companies now invest in private companies. That&#8217;s great for the companies, because by the way as a private company, you don&#8217;t have the kind of quarterly scrutiny that you do when you&#8217;re public, and I think it&#8217;s actually easier to out-innovate and out-flank public companies when you are private, which is one thing I personally like. But that said, it does keep more of that growth in the hands of only sophisticated investors.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I completely agree.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: So there is a lot more of that upside that is no longer in the hands of what is commonly referred to as the retail investor. I would love for anyone who loves Automatic&#8217;s products to be able to own a share of the company, even if it&#8217;s just one share. That&#8217;s not really possible under the current sort of regulatory frameworks, and for good reasons, by the way. As we saw with the kind of ICO craze, there&#8217;s a reason all these protections for consumers and public market, public company standards exist.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: But in the meantime, at Automatic we will continue to hold ourselves to public company standards, but really build in an extremely long-term way. If there&#8217;s an idol there, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s Amazon, and try to make the best possible user experience, best possible products. If we continue to do that, I think from a business point of view we will have an array of options available to us and any number of choices.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: And as a leader yourself of the WordPress community and Automatic, what&#8217;s one big thing that you learned this year that you hope to improve upon in 2019?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Hmm, I know you&#8217;re probably thinking about like a big thing, but I&#8217;m actually going to say a small thing.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It can be small.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It&#8217;s really important, which is how much you can &#8230; What is the one thing everyone listening to this is doing right now?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Focusing, I hope?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Breathing.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Oh, okay.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And you probably weren&#8217;t thinking about it, but now you are thinking about it. You&#8217;re breathing right now.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: I am.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: And it is amazing how much you can influence your mindset, your state of mind, your mood, your everything, through breath. Just as an exercise, where everyone puts their hand on their belly and takes a big breath and pushes your hand out as you take it in, Brian, are you doing it?</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Oh, sorry. I do. I feel good.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: It has an immediate effect on you.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: It does. You know, actually that&#8217;s how we discipline our son often. A three-year-old is a very emotional being, so if they&#8217;re upset one of the first things that you can do with them is just tell them, &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a deep breath together.&#8221; So you take that deep breath and the response is also very immediate, the way they calm down and settle down and think more clearly because they took that breath, so that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: That&#8217;s all of us, and also by the way, this is not something new. This goes back thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: You didn&#8217;t just invent this?</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: No, no, you know there&#8217;s so many, there&#8217;s so much prior art here, but I&#8217;d encourage people to check it out. Also check out, when the videos go up, the Joanna Barsh talk, and Alexis Lloyd both had sort of almost like guided meditations and exercises. I think this is one of the next big areas for people who aren&#8217;t familiar with to discover. They&#8217;re actually really, really powerful, and it&#8217;s been huge for me. In an extraordinarily busy and what might otherwise be seen as extremely stressful year, it was actually one of my best years of my life.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: Awesome.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: I do have to watch a clock, and I do have to run now.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard: That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m happy to hear that. Thank you for spending so much time with me. It was great talking to you, and we&#8217;ll catch everybody next time.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: Thank you. I&#8217;ll see you all, and thank you to all Post Status readers.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 14:45:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: State of the Word 2018: WordPress Embraces the Block Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86291\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2018-wordpress-embraces-the-block-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13953:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PIC_20181208_161427272.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: WP Tavern</p>\n<p>WordCamp US kicked off in Nashville over the weekend, following the release of WordPress 5.0. In the first 48 hours, 5.0 had been downloaded more than 2.8 million times. It passed 3 million Saturday night.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot that&#8217;s been going on, so I&#8217;d like to allow WordPress the chance to re-introduce itself,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said during the preamble of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWlfp-1Q19I\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Word</a> address. He invoked the four freedoms as the project&#8217;s constitution and called the community back to its roots. </p>\n<p>“It&#8217;s the reason we&#8217;re here,” Mullenweg said. “WordPress isn&#8217;t a physical thing; it&#8217;s not a set of code. It&#8217;s kind of an idea.  WordPress is backed by the full faith and credit of every person and company that depends on it.”  </p>\n<p>He reiterated the project’s mission to democratize publishing and recast his vision for advancing the open web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like I said a few years ago, we&#8217;re building a web operating system, an operating system for the open, independent web and a platform that others can truly build on,” Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>WordPress’ 32.5% market share and its commercial ecosystem, which Mullenweg estimates at $10 billion/year,  give the project the resources to make a powerful impact on the future of the web. </p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Builds a Compelling Case for the Block Editor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wcus-sotw.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/1071531659579789313\">WCUS Photography Team</a></p>\n<p>Mullenweg drove home the necessity of Gutenberg by showing a selection of videos where new users struggled to accomplish simple tasks in the old editor.  Their experiences were accompanied by painful commentary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;This feels like writing a blog back in 2005.”</li>\n<li>&#8220;This was very finnicky; this does not work.”</li>\n<li>&#8220;How would I add a caption? I have no clue.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mullenweg described how he used to effortlessly switch back and forth between the visual and HTML editors prior to WordPress 5.0 but realized that not all users are able to do this.  </p>\n<p>”This has been our editor experience for over a decade now and many of us have learned to deal with it,” he said.</p>\n<p>He followed up with a video demonstrating how much easier these tasks are in the new block editor and identified blocks as the way forward for WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some attendees commented after the fact on how the user testing videos, paired up against an expert using Gutenberg, seemed unbalanced and they would have liked to see videos of new users attempting the same tasks in the new editor. The goal of that segment, however, seemed to be more aimed at communicating the need for Gutenberg and the possibilities it opens up once users have had the chance to grow into it.</p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Urges Attendees to &#8220;Learn Blocks Deeply&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Millions of early adopters have already embraced the block editor during phase 1 of the Gutenberg project, which closed out with 1.2 million active installs and 1.2 million posts written. There have already been 277 WordCamp talks on Gutenberg, 555 meetup events focused on the new editor, and more than 1,000 blog posts discussing it.</p>\n<p>Blocks are taking over the world of WordPress. Version 5.0 shipped with 70 native blocks and there are already more than 100 third-party blocks in existence and 1,000 configurations related to that. </p>\n<p>“Blocks are predictable, tactile, and can be simple like a text block, or as rich as an e-commerce interface,” Mullenweg said. He described them as the new DNA of WordPress, from which users can create anything they can imagine. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg showcased two sites built using the block editor, the <a href=\"https://theindigomill.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indigo Mill</a> and <a href=\"https://www.luminasolar.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lumina Solar</a>. These beautiful sites open the imagination to what Gutenberg is capable of bringing to websites.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org will be highlighting plugins and themes to push the block ecosystem forward. There are also more than 100 Gutenberg-ready themes available to users on the directory and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/blocks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new Gutenberg block tag that is currently live for plugins</a>. It will also be available for themes soon. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg highlighted tools like the create-guten-block toolkit, Block Lab, and Lazy Blocks that are making it easy for developers to create their own blocks. Block collections and libraries are also emerging. He said one of the priorities for 2019 is to build a WordPress.org directory for discovering blocks and a way to seamlessly install them.</p>\n<p>Building on the homework he gave to WordPress developers in 2015, to “<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Learn JavaScript Deeply</a>,” Mullenweg urged the community to “Learn Blocks Deeply.”  Blocks provide a host of opportunities to improve the user experience beyond what Gutenberg’s creators could have imagined in the beginning.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Phase 2: Navigation Menu Block, Widget blocks, Theme Content Areas</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg announced the next phases for the Gutenberg project. Phase 2 has already begun and focuses on site customization, expanding the block interface to other aspects of content management.  This includes creating a navigation menu block. Reimagining menus is will be challenging, and Mullenweg said they may even get renamed during the process.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 goals also include porting all widgets over to blocks and registering theme content areas in Gutenberg. An early version of phase 2 will be in the Gutenberg plugin so anyone wanting to be part of testing can reactivate it.</p>\n<p>During the Q&#038;A time, one attendee asked a question about how this phase seems to include very little about making layout capabilities more robust. He asked if Mullenweg plans to let those the marketplace handle those layout decision or if core will define a layout language. Mullenweg responded that it may be more prudent to see what others in the ecosystem are doing and cherry pick and adopt the best solutions. He also remarked that it would be exciting if users could switch between different page builders in the future and not lose their content. </p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Phases 3 and 4: Collaboration and Core Support for Multilingual Sites</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg announced that Gutenberg phase 3, targeted for 2020, will focus on collaboration, multi-user editing, and workflows. Phase 4 (2020+) is aimed at developing an official way for WordPress to support multilingual sites. When asked what that will look like from a technical standpoint, given the many existing solutions already available, Mullenweg said he didn’t want to prescribe anything yet, as it’s still in the experimental stage.</p>\n<p>Other major announcements included a highly anticipated bump in the minimum PHP version required for using WordPress. By April 2019, PHP 5.6 will be the minimum PHP version for WordPress, and by December 2019, the requirement will be updated to PHP 7.</p>\n<p>WordPress releases are going to come faster in the future, as Gutenberg development has set a new pace for iteration. Mullenweg said he would like WordPress to get to the point where users are not thinking about what version they are on but instead choose a channel where they can easily run betas or the stable version.</p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Acknowledges Mistakes Made and Lessons Learned in the 5.0 Release Process</h3>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 was one of the longest and most controversial release cycles in the project’s history. Those outside the inner circle of decision-making endured a great deal of uncertainty, as dates were announced and then missed, with secondary dates thrown out in favor of pushing 5.0 out with just three days’ notice. </p>\n<p>“We were scared to announce a new release date after missing our previous one,” Mullenweg said, acknowledging the controversial release date. He said this seemed to create a lot of fear and uncertainty until they announced a new date. The dates seemed to come out of the blue and were stressful for the community. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg highlighted the lessons they learned in the process of releasing 5.0: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need the various teams across WordPress working together better</li>\n<li>Need to keep learning JavaScript, even more deeply</li>\n<li>Importance of triage and code freezes</li>\n<li>Always announce release dates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mullenweg noted that WordPress 5.0’s beta releases were tested 100 times more than other releases, which he said contributed to Gutenberg becoming more robust before landing in 5.0. However, these positives seemed to be overshadowed by several critical breakdowns in communication that many feel betrayed the community’s trust.</p>\n<p>He noted that people used the plugin review system as a way to vote on Gutenberg and that perhaps the community needs a different medium for expressing those kinds of things. Users did this because they felt it was one of the only feedback mechanisms where they had a voice. Negative reviews piled on in the early days of the plugin’s development but they continued steadily throughout the feature plugin’s journey into core. After 5.0 was released, negative <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviews on the Gutenberg plugin</a> have continued to pour in, and its rating has fallen to 2.2/5 stars.</p>\n<h3>Growing Pains and a Call for Transparency</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wcus2018.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: David Bisset for <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a></p>\n<p>Mullenweg said that Gutenberg development happened entirely in the public eye, surfacing many challenges associated with developing open source software in public. The code was public, but the most important decisions were made behind closed doors. This was compounded by the developer community voicing frustrations during core dev chats and on social media. </p>\n<p>During the Q&#038;A segment, several audience members called for more transparency in the release process, noting that most of the posts and announcements regarding 5.0 came from Automattic employees. Morten Rand-Hendriksen, who has become somewhat of a community firebrand at WordCamp Q&#038;A’s, received applause for his question regarding the use of the word “we” in connection to posts on the make blogs. He pressed Mullenweg for more insight into where these decisions are made. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg said the “we” he meant in regards to 5.0 release dates referred to a private channel where the release leads discussed it. He said with so many people showing up to the dev chats, the discussions became difficult.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just go in a cave and come up with these things,&#8221; Mullenweg said. “A lot of people were showing up [to dev chats] who had never contributed to WordPress before and were crowding out the discussion of the core team.” He also said the private conversations were “every bit as feisty as the public one,” except there weren’t any drive-by opinions. </p>\n<p>To those on the outside, these meetings appeared to be secret, as they were never referenced or summarized on the make blogs. This left the developer community wondering where these decisions were coming from and whether or not they had a voice.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gutenberg was developed in public, but too many decisions were made in silos and not clearly communicated. This can be improved for 5.1 and beyond <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCUS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCUS</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; K. Adam White (@kadamwhite) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kadamwhite/status/1071539824358764544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>During the Q&#038;A, Mulllenweg said he listened to vigorous discussion and diverse viewpoints from release leads coming from different companies, while gathering as much information as possible from reading reviews, blog posts, and comments from the community. He described this process as part of the art of trying to make sense of all the different things people are saying and balance that.</p>\n<p>Supporting a BDFL-led project requires a certain amount of trust that the leadership is listening. Over the past several weeks Mullenweg has made a strong effort to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mullenweg-ramps-up-communication-ahead-of-wordpress-5-0-release-rc2-now-available\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">keep the channels of communication open</a>.  </p>\n<p>The painful user testing videos Mullenweg shared demonstrated how desperately WordPress needed to grow out of its old editor. It isn’t often that core makes changes that affect nearly every corner of the WordPress ecosystem at the same time. This experience came with its fair share of growing pains. Despite communication missteps during the 5.0 release process, Mullenweg has successfully navigated the project through this rocky transition. Although WordCamp US attendees seemed road weary after 5.0, they were united by a shared desire to move forward and continue working together with the leadership that has kept WordPress on the course of growth and improvement for the past 15 years.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:23:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: State of the Word 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48685\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2018/12/state-of-the-word-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1048:\"<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend I was in Nashville with over a thousand other WordPress enthusiasts.

This year we covered user testing, Gutenberg, 5.0, the future phases of Gutenberg, all the latest and greatest blocks, new minimum PHP requirements, the adoption of 5.0, and some event and community updates.

And it&#8217;s good to return to users to find that,” Matt acknowledged.</p>\n<h3>Enhancing editor usability</h3>\n<p>A video of new WordPress users testing the classic editor (WordPress 4.9) was shown projected on the big screens over the stage. These clips primarily showed people having difficulties with relatively simple tasks in the editor.</p>\n<p>Matt&#8217;s point was that we&#8217;ve become accustomed to the custom editor&#8217;s quirks, but blocks offer a better experience — from copying and pasting from Microsoft Word and Google Docs into WordPress to quickly creating a responsive website.</p>\n<h3>Community Gutenberg adoption</h3>\n<p>Matt continued with a summary of how Gutenberg has performed in Phase 1 of its release. Before the WordPress 5.0 release, 1.2 million active installs and 1.2 million posts were published, with about 39,000 posts written daily. Phase 1 had 8,684 commits and over 340 contributors. The &#8216;Gutenberg&#8217; tag is already available for plugins in the WordPress repo, and it will be “coming soon” for themes.</p>\n<p>Notably, over 100 Gutenberg themes are already present in the WordPress repo — including the new Twenty Nineteen theme. Matt highlighted two websites — <a href=\"http://theindigomill.com\">The Indigo Mill</a> and <a href=\"http://luminasolar.com\">Lumina Solar</a> — as examples where Gutenberg blocks have been used well to create effective layouts. Matt riffed on the &#8220;Learn JavaScript Deeply&#8221; mantra by repeating &#8220;Learn Blocks Deeply.&#8221; Blocks are the DNA of the new editor. Currently, 70 native blocks and over 100 third-party blocks exist for Gutenberg.</p>\n<h3>Community Gutenberg development</h3>\n<p>He highlighted some of the third party blocks in the wild:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-0-introducing-the-yoast-seo-gutenberg-sidebar-a-revamped-meta-box/\">Yoast SEO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevinbazira/algori-360-image\">360 Image</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/the-official-amp-plugin-for-wordpress/\">Google AMP w/ Gutenberg Integration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/dropit/\">Drop It</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ecwid-shopping-cart/\">Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/making-it-easier-to-add-products-to-posts-and-pages-with-the-products-block-for-gutenberg/\">WooCommerce Products Block</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/wordpress-ecommerce-plugin/\">BigCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpzoom.com/plugins/new-plugin-released-recipe-card-blocks-for-gutenberg/\">Recipe Card Blocks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tarot/\">Tarot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmsnell23/status/1063126946350096389\">Sketch Block</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-blocks/form-block/\">Jetpack Form Block</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sortabrilliant.com/guidepost/\">Guidepost</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sortabrilliant.com/ghostwriter/\">Ghost Writing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sortabrilliant.com/spoileralert/\">Spoiler Alert</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\">Caxton Shape Divider Block</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matt mentioned several block libraries and frameworks that have appeared:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://editorblockswp.com\">editorblockswp.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gutenberghub.com\">gutenberghub.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gutenbergcloud.org\">gutenbergcloud.org</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://getblocklab.com\">getblocklab.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-blocks/\">Lazy Blocks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>\n<p>Matt gave the audience an update regarding the WordPress native mobile apps: In the past month, app users published 1.3M posts and uploaded 3.1M photos and videos. Gutenberg will be going into the mobile apps, with a beta release expected in February 2019; I heard February 22nd is the current target date for a beta release.</p>\n<h3>The Next Phases of Gutenberg</h3>\n<p>Matt highlighted the next phases of Gutenberg&#8217;s evolution, which included new information about Phases Three and Four:</p>\n<h4>Phase One</h4>\n<p>Fundamental blocks for writing and editing in the backend editor. These are complete now, although Matt later said that work on the editor would continue.</p>\n<h4>Phase Two</h4>\n<p>Customizing outside of the page/post content will be the next point of emphasis. It may include widgets, menus, and miscellaneous content. Matt notes that menus “will need a bit more experimentation”. &#8220;2019&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Phase Three</h4>\n<p>Collaboration, multi-user editing in Gutenberg, and workflows. The target for this to phase to be complete is “2020+.”</p>\n<h4>Phase Four</h4>\n<p>&#8220;An official way&#8221; for WordPress to support multilingual sites. Also slated for “2020+.”</p>\n<h3>Other Announcements</h3>\n<p>There were several non-Gutenberg tidbits of note:</p>\n<h4>Auto updates on major versions of WordPress</h4>\n<p>On a list of items to work on in 2019, Matt said he wanted to make it a goal to add optional auto-updates for plugins, themes, and major versions of WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Updated minimum PHP versions</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">A proposal written</a> by Gary Pendergast makes a case for WordPress to start updating its minimum PHP versions. The proposed plan is to move to PHP 5.6 by April 2019 and to PHP 7.0 by &#8220;as early as&#8221; December 2019. Notably, security support for PHP 5.6 expires in a few days, and the &#8220;end of life&#8221; for PHP 7.0 <a href=\"http://php.net/supported-versions.php\">just passed</a>.</p>\n<p>After Matt mentioned this proposal, it received an enormous amount of applause — far more applause than most of the Gutenberg news that came earlier, and Matt noticed. It is definitely welcome news!</p>\n<h4>WordPress release adoption</h4>\n<p>During the life of the WordPress 4.9 branch, there were over 173 million downloads with 68.4% of all known WordPress installs running 4.9.</p>\n<p>Matt notes that the early adoption numbers for WordPress 5.0 were very similar to WordPress 4.7, which was also a December release back in 2016.</p>\n<h4>Lessons learned in 2018</h4>\n<p>Matt took time to summarize the lessons he learned in 2018, starting with the need for teams to improve how they work together: “There should be no reason for accessibility, testing, and other teams not to be working together since these features should be a feature of everything we develop from the very beginning.” No doubt this came as a response to the concerns about accessibility in Gutenberg that surfaced before WordPress 5.0 was released.</p>\n<h3>Community Update</h3>\n<p>Matt offered some community-related data as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordCamps:</strong> In 2018 there were 145 WordCamps in 48 countries, with over 45,000 tickets sold. A total of 1,300 organizers (a 33% increase!), 2,651 speakers, and 1,175 sponsors made it all possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Meetups:</strong> This year saw 50% member growth in meetup attendance, with over 687 meetup groups and 5,400 meetup events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And with that, he began Q&amp;A.</p>\n<p>You can view the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5b-N2RmxS8\">State of the Word on YouTube</a> in full, and it should become available on WordPress TV very soon.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49969\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-49969 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wcus-2018-sotw-5542-752x439.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"439\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos by <a href=\"https://wpsessions.com\">Brian Richards</a>, for Post Status.</p></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 15:45:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: AMP Plugin for WordPress Version 1.0 Introduces Gutenberg-Integrated AMP Validation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/amp-plugin-for-wordpress-version-1-0-introduces-gutenberg-integrated-amp-validation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2620:\"<p><a href=\"https://amp-wp.org/amp-plugin-1-0-stable-release/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 1.0</a> of the official AMP plugin for WordPress was released on the eve of WordCamp US, after two years in development by contributors from Automattic, XWP, and Google. This first stable version has a massive <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/#developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a> with 30 people credited for their contributions. The plugin is now considered ready for production and is active on more than 300,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 interfaces with the new editor that landed in WordPress 5.0. It will display warnings for AMP-invalid markup on a per-block basis, so users don&#8217;t have to guess what content is generating an issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/notices-in-blocks-1024x736.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces a compatibility tool that offers detailed information on AMP validation errors. It functions like a debugging page where users can see which URLs are generating errors, along with the site component (plugin, theme, or core) where the markup originates.</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 includes granular controls for selecting which templates will be served as AMP. This allows for a more gradual adoption across a site. Users can also opt for Native mode to have the entire site served as AMP.</p>\n<p>The plugin has been updated to support four of WordPress&#8217; default themes, including Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen, Twenty Seventeen, and Twenty Nineteen. The documentation for <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wordpress-develop/pull/307\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how AMP was added to these bundled themes</a> serves as an example for how theme developers can make their own themes AMP-compatible. </p>\n<p>WordPress users who opt to use AMP on their sites will have a more successful experience with this version, thanks to the improved UI for handling AMP validation errors and the new interface for limiting AMP-support to certain templates.</p>\n<p>The AMP for WordPress project is also sporting a new <a href=\"https://amp-wp.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> that features a collection of AMP-ready plugins and themes and a showcase of sites using AMP. It also has extensive <a href=\"https://amp-wp.org/documentation/getting-started/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for implementors, site owners, and developers. The site provides a central place for news and resources related to the project and its expanding ecosystem of compatible extensions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Dec 2018 06:51:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.0 “Bebo” Released, Lays A Foundation for the Platform’s Future\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86229\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-bebo-released-lays-a-foundation-for-the-platforms-future\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9407:\"<p>In 2016 at WordCamp US in Philadelphia, PA, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\">Matt Mullenweg announced</a> to the world that a new post and page editor would be coming to WordPress. &#8220;The editor does not represent the core of WordPress publishing,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">vision of the editor</a> was geared towards a more block-based approach that unifies widgets, shortcodes, and other areas of WordPress. Today, that vision has become a reality with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/\">release of WordPress 5.0</a> featuring <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\">project Gutenberg</a>. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />The New Editor in WordPress 5.0</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of a large blank canvas, content is broken up into a series of individual blocks that are independent from the content as a whole. For example, you can edit the HTML of one block without it affecting other blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The editor comes with more than 16 blocks to add content. You can add more blocks by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-block-library-provides-a-searchable-index-of-individual-blocks\">installing and activating plugins.</a><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Some of the Blocks That Are Available in WordPress 5.0</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Each block typically has two areas where you can manipulate its content. The Toolbar, which displays when hovering over a block, and the Inspector located in the right-hand sidebar. The Inspector houses less-often used settings that require more screen space. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the top toolbar, block toolbar, inspector, block mover, and hidden elements that don&#8217;t appear unless hovered over, there are a lot of user interface buttons. I suggest spending time crafting a test post to get familiar with what each button does. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see the new editor in action, check out the following demo video. </p>\n\n\n\nA Short Demo of The New Editor in Action\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not ready for the new editor or discover incompatibilities with themes or plugins, you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor</a> plugin. This plugin will disable the new editor and replace it with the one in WordPress 4.9.8 and below. The WordPress development team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\">has committed</a> to supporting the plugin until December 31st, 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who use assistive technology and experience accessibility issues with the new editor are encouraged to install the Classic Editor plugin until the issues are fixed. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twenty Nineteen: A Fully Compatible Default Theme<br /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 comes with a new default theme called <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/\">Twenty Nineteen</a> that is fully compatible with the new editor. It includes front-end and back-end styles to provide a What You See Is What You Get experience. It also supports the Wide and Full image alignment options. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Twenty Nineteen Front-End on the Left, Back-End on the Right</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the theme in action on <a href=\"https://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s site</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Happens to Existing Content?<br /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Content not created in the new editor is placed into a Classic block. This block mimics the old editor and provides users a choice to migrate it into blocks. However, migrating content into blocks is not required. Most content shouldn&#8217;t be affected by updating to WordPress 5.0. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to Get Help Using the New Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For new users, the editor might be an intuitive experience but for many WordPress veterans, it introduces a steep learning curve. After all, the previous editor has existed for more than 10 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, there is a Gutenberg handbook for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/\">Developers</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/contributors/\">Contributors</a> but not for Users. Work <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/11252\">is underway</a> by the Docs team and other volunteer contributors to put together an initial document to release in 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the official handbook is published, you&#8217;ll need to seek help and education elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress 5.0 Essential Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen, an educator for LinkedIn Learning has published <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/?trk=insiders_23476852_learning\">a course</a> that walks users through the new editor. It&#8217;s available to view for free for the next three weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gutenberg Times<br /></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack has been keeping tabs on Gutenberg&#8217;s development for more than a year. <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com\">Gutenberg Times</a> contains relevant information about the editor for <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/category/for-users/\">users</a> and <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/category/for-developers/\">developers</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress Support Forums<br /></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers are standing by ready to answer your questions. If you think you&#8217;ve discovered a bug, incompatibility, or are experiencing trouble with the new editor, please post it in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/how-to-and-troubleshooting/\">support forums</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress 5.0 Field Guide</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/06/wordpress-5-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 5.0 field guide</a> provides important links and information for developers and users related to this release. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress 5.0 Is the Beginning of A New Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress 5.0 introduces a new editor, it also lays the foundation for what&#8217;s to come. The first phase of project Gutenberg was the editor. The second phase is the Customizer with a focus on full-site layouts. The third and fourth phases will be shared and discussed by Mullenweg at this year&#8217;s WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new editor is part of a long process to reinvent WordPress. Matías Ventura, Co-lead of the Gutenberg project succinctly explains why the need for Gutenberg exists. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>WordPress has always been about the user experience, and that needs to continue to evolve under newer demands. Gutenberg is an attempt at fundamentally addressing those needs, based on the idea of content blocks. It’s an attempt to improve how users interact with their content in a fundamentally visual way, while at the same time giving developers the tools to create more fulfilling experiences for the people they are helping.</p><p>How can such a vision happen without dismantling, rebuilding, fragmenting, or breaking the WordPress ship that for over a decade has been carrying the thoughts, joys, and livelihoods of millions of people and more than a quarter of the web?</p><p>The ship, like Theseus’, needs to continue sailing while we upgrade the materials that make it. It needs to adapt to welcome new people, those that find it too rough to climb on board, too slippery a surface, too unwelcoming a sight, while retaining its essence of liberty. This is not an easy challenge—not in the slightest. </p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">we called it Gutenberg for a reason</a>, for both its challenges and opportunities, for what it can represent in terms of continuity and change. It is an ambitious project and it needs the whole WordPress community to succeed.</p><cite><a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\">Matías Ventura, Co-lead of the Gutenberg project.<br /></a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As the new editor <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/counter/\">makes its way</a> across the world, it will be interesting to see what the reactions are from users who experience it for the first time. It will also be interesting to see what the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1069327043618320385\">developer community builds</a> that takes the editor to new heights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 is the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gutenberg-morten-rand-hendriksen\">beginning of a new journey</a> for the project. One that will have bumpy roads, new discoveries, and plenty of opportunities to learn. So saddle up and keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle until it makes a complete stop. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 is named after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebo_Vald%C3%A9s\">Bebo Valdés</a> who was a Cuban pianist, bandleader, composer and arranger. The release was led by Matt Mullenweg with Allan Cole, Anthony Burchell, Gary Pendergast, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Laurel Fulford, Omar Reiss, Daniel Bachhuber, Matías Ventura, Miguel Fonseca, Tammie Lister, Matthew Riley MacPherson as co-leads. At least 423 people contributed to the release. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 21:38:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0 “Bebo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6328\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44136:\"<h2>Say Hello to the New Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve made some big upgrades to the editor.

Here are a few of the blocks to help you get started:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-4 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Paragraph.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6340\" />Paragraph</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Heading.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6341\" />Heading</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Preformatted.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6342\" />Preformatted</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Quote.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6343\" />Quote</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Image.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6344\" />Image</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Gallery.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6345\" />Gallery</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Cover-Image.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6346\" />Cover</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Video.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6347\" />Video</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Audio.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6348\" />Audio</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Column.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6349\" />Columns</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-File.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6350\" />File</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Code.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6351\" />Code</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-List.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6352\" />List</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Button.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6353\" />Button</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-Embeds.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6354\" />Embeds</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2018/12/Block-Icon-More.jpg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6355\" />More</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Freedom to Build, Freedom to Write</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This new editing experience provides a more consistent treatment of design as well as content.

No problem! Support for the Classic Editor plugin will remain in WordPress through 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Classic Editor plugin restores the previous WordPress editor and the Edit Post screen. It lets you keep using plugins that extend it, add old-style meta boxes, or otherwise depend on the previous editor. To install, visit your plugins page and click the “Install Now” button next to “Classic Editor”. After the plugin finishes installing, click “Activate”. That’s it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note to users of assistive technology: if you experience usability issues with the block editor, we recommend you continue to use the Classic Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button aligncenter\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Check out the Classic Editor</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This release is named in homage to the pioneering Cuban jazz musician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebo_Vald%C3%A9s\">Bebo Valdés</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>The Squad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, along with co-leads <a href=\"https://www.allancole.com/\">Allan Cole</a>, <a href=\"http://antpb.com/\">Anthony Burchell</a>, <a href=\"https://pento.net/\">Gary Pendergast</a>, <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, <a href=\"https://laurel.blog/\">Laurel Fulford</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/about-us/team/omar-reiss/\">Omar Reiss</a>, <a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/\">Daniel Bachhuber</a>, <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/\">Matías Ventura</a>, <a href=\"https://lamda.blog/\">Miguel Fonseca</a>, <a href=\"https://tam.blog/\">Tammie Lister</a>, <a href=\"https://tofumatt.com/\">Matthew Riley MacPherson</a>.

Are you wondering which WordPress membership plugin to use? Choosing the right platform to build your membership site on makes all the difference when it comes to growing your business and making more money.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll share with you the best membership plugins for WordPress so you can make an informed decision that meets your needs.</p>\n<h3>The Benefits of Creating a Membership Website</h3>\n<p>There are many ways to <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/make-money-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make money online</a>, but creating a membership website is one of the most effective. A membership site lets you limit access to your site’s content, downloads, forums, support team, and more to registered users.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the reasons you might want to build a membership site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generate Steady Income:</strong> By requiring site visitors to pay for access to your membership site, you generate a consistent stream of recurring income that increases as more people register.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a Bigger Email List:</strong> All small business owners look for ways to improve their <a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/beginners-guide-to-email-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing strategies</a>. And that all begins with building a bigger email list. Adding registered users to your email list helps keep your list full of active members that are more likely to respond to your email campaigns.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliver More Value:</strong> The great thing about creating a membership site is that the content you limit access to is evergreen, meaning it will be valuable to people forever. It’s also packed into one convenient location for everyone to see. You can easily build on that content to create even more value for your users, which will encourage them to continue paying you for access.</li>\n<li><strong>One Word: Automation:</strong> Though you can continue to build on the content that you offer registered users, you don’t have to. If you do all the work at the start, and create a robust membership site for your target audience to enjoy, you technically don’t ever have to do anything else. Unless you want to update content from time to time, or you offer support, the content on your membership does all the work for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, building a membership website will help you establish yourself as an authority in your industry. Providing high-quality content and requiring payment to access it asserts the fact that you’re an expert and understand the value of what you know.</p>\n<h3>What to Look For in a WordPress Membership Plugin</h3>\n<p>Each type of membership site will require a specific set of features to function right.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the most common types of membership sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online courses that include interactive projects, documents such as PDFs, and video content</li>\n<li>The all-in-one site that gives paying customers access to everything for a monthly subscription</li>\n<li>Online communities that have forums, live chats, articles to read, and other resources that aren’t available to unregistered users</li>\n<li>Service-based memberships that require customers to pay for access to services you provide, such as coaching or consulting</li>\n<li>Product-based memberships where physical or <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/the-simplest-way-to-sell-digital-products-on-your-wordpress-site/\">digital products</a> are sent to members on a recurring basis</li>\n<li>Fixed-term memberships where members have access to locked content for a set amount of time</li>\n<li>Drip feed models where locked content is revealed as members progress through a program</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that’s just the beginning.</p>\n<p>Luckily, most of the best WordPress membership plugins in the market today are capable of helping you create whatever type of membership site you want.</p>\n<p>That said, not all membership plugins are created equal. Below, we have some of the most important things to keep in mind when choosing a membership plugin for your WordPress site.</p>\n<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of your skill set, you’ll want a plugin that&#8217;s easy to use. Some complex membership plugins offer tons of functionality that you’ll never need. Others will be super lightweight, offering only the basics needed to get a membership site up and running.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the type of membership site you want to build, make sure the platform you’re using is easy to set up. To make things easier on you, you can always use a more lightweight solution and invest in additional functionality when needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>\n<p>As with all WordPress plugins, it’s important you make sure the membership plugin you choose is compatible with your existing WordPress plugins and theme. If it’s not, you could end up breaking your site and making things a lot harder on yourself.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, test your membership plugin on a local WordPress install first. If everything cooperates, you know it’s safe to use your solution on your live site.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>Though many membership plugins come with all the features you need right out of the box, you should check before investing in a solution. Many membership plugins have multiple plans that come with different sets of features (and price tags).</p>\n<p>While every membership website is different, here are some of the most important features to look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Member management</li>\n<li>Support for forums and live chats</li>\n<li>Email marketing tools</li>\n<li>Digital download support</li>\n<li>Course building tools</li>\n<li>Content drip functionality</li>\n<li>Multi-level subscriptions</li>\n<li>Coupons and discounts</li>\n<li>Recurring subscriptions</li>\n<li>Design templates and other design features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having an idea what type of membership site you want to create will help you decide whether the solution you’re considering has the features you need.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s take a look at the top WordPress membership plugins so you can decide which one is right for you.</p>\n<h3>1. <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"MemberPress\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/memberpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MemberPress</a></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-362248\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/memberpress.png\" alt=\"memberpress\" width=\"562\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/memberpress.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/memberpress-300x184.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>MemberPress is one of the easiest to use WordPress membership plugins.

But if you notice trends in the geographic locations of your site visitors, it’s wise to use this data to help you grow your business.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at how to find out the locations of site visitors filling out your WordPress forms.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a New WordPress Form</h3>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms plugin</a>. For more details, see this step by step guide on <a title=\"Step by step guide on How to Install a WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to install a plugin in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, create a new WordPress form. For help with this step, you can check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-simple-contact-form-in-wordpress/\">how to create a simple contact form</a> in WordPress. Just remember, no matter which type of WordPress form you create, you can track the location of your leads.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218831\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Simple-Contact-Form.png\" alt=\"Simple Contact Form\" width=\"562\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Simple-Contact-Form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Simple-Contact-Form-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You can add additional fields to your WordPress form by dragging them from the left hand panel to the right hand panel.</p>\n<p>Then, click on the field to make any changes. You can also click on a form field and drag it to rearrange the order on your contact form.</p>\n<p>When your form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Install and Activate the Geolocation Addon</h3>\n<p>Once your WordPress form is ready, you’ll need to install and activate the WPForms <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/geolocation-addon/\">Geolocation addon</a>.</p>\n<p>This addon lets you collect and store your site visitors’ geolocation data when they submit forms on your website.

In other words, there are no settings to configure. Once the addon is installed and activated, it’s ready to work for you.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: View Geolocation Data in Form Entries</h3>\n<p>Once someone submits a form on your website, the Geolocation addon automatically collects the site visitor’s location information.</p>\n<p>To view the geolocation data, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Entries</strong> and click <strong>View</strong> to access a form entry’s submission data.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361175\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/view-form-entry-data.png\" alt=\"view form entry data\" width=\"562\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/view-form-entry-data.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/view-form-entry-data-300x219.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Once you do this, you’ll see an interactive Google Map, as well as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>City, State</li>\n<li>Zipcode</li>\n<li>Country</li>\n<li>Approximate latitude and longitude</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361174\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interactive-map.png\" alt=\"interactive map\" width=\"562\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interactive-map.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interactive-map-300x251.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>This information directly relates to the user that submitted the form.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!

Without having to mess with PayPal’s embed code, you can add a PayPal payment button in just a few clicks.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works on your site.</p>\n<p>When a visitor clicks on the payment button, a modal popup will appear that requires your visitor to complete the checkout.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-111056\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jetpack-payment-button-paypal-checkout.png\" alt=\"jetpack payment button- paypal checkout\" width=\"562\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jetpack-payment-button-paypal-checkout.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jetpack-payment-button-paypal-checkout-300x242.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>The Simple Payment Button by Jetpack is a nice choice for you if you’re already subscribed to Jetpack’s Premium and Professional plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s quick and easy</strong>: Whenever you want to add a payment button, you don’t have to mess with the PayPal embed code. In just a few clicks, you can add a payment button on your site’s posts or pages and start accepting payments.</li>\n<li><strong>No redirect</strong>: Clicking on the button will trigger a modal popup asking your visitors to complete the checkout. That means payments will process without redirecting users to any other site.</li>\n<li><strong>Notification</strong>: When a payment processes, you’ll receive an email notifying you about the payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bloated</strong>: The Jetpack plugin comes with too many features. You’ll never need most of those features on your site. If you’re not already a Jetpack user, you might not want to install it just for the Simple Payment Button. Bloated plugins can decrease your <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-performance-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">site’s speed and performance</a> and negatively affect the user experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Too costly</strong>: The Simple Payment Button is only available to Jetpack Premium and Professional customers, which costs you a minimum of $99 a year. If you’re not subscribed to any of these plans already, there’s no reason to purchase the plugin just for embedding a PayPal button on your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Not suitable for selling products or services</strong>: If you’re looking to sell your product or services, you might want to get additional information from your customers during the checkout process. With Jetpack Simple Payment Button, there is no way to access any additional information along with the payment.</li>\n<li><strong>No Stripe support</strong>: Currently, Jetpack doesn’t support Stripe payments. This limits the type of payments you can accept from site visitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Requires you to connect with WordPress.com</strong>: In order to use most of the Jetpack features, you must connect your site with your WordPress.com account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Easiest Way to Accept Payment</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-74241\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wpformslogo.png\" alt=\"WPForms logo\" width=\"549\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wpformslogo.png 549w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wpformslogo-300x89.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" /></p>\n<p>Whether you’re accepting donations or <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/make-money-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selling products or services</a>, using WPForms is the easiest way to accept payments from customers.

Your employees will have a different perspective and can highlight obstacles you didn’t know existed.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost Employee Satisfaction:</strong> Discover what motivates your employees, what brings their morale down, and what they wish you would do differently by analyzing employee survey results. The more satisfied your employees, the more productive they’ll be, which is a win-win for you and them.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Data Collection:</strong> When you conduct a survey on your website using a reliable survey solution such as <a href=\"https://wpforms.com\">WPForms</a>, you can collect data in one convenient location. Plus, you can organize survey results, access survey answers, and export specific questions for each department so improvements can begin right away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, there are other reasons why you should find out what is on your employees’ minds. For instance, you can improve communication, change the workplace climate, solve issues before someone leaves, and gather new business ideas from those that are most involved with the day to day operations of your business.</p>\n<p>If you want to create an employee satisfaction survey on your WordPress site, check out this helpful tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/create-a-survey-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/\">how to create a survey form in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at some of the most important employee survey questions you should be asking everyone that works for you.</p>\n<h3>The Best Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions</h3>\n<p>There are many areas you can explore when it comes to your employee surveys.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to ask employee survey questions related to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compensation – find out whether you’re paying people what they think they’re worth.</li>\n<li>Benefits – determine whether the health insurance, retirement plans, paid vacation time, and more are satisfactory.</li>\n<li>Career Development – do employees feel there is room to grow within your business? Are you challenging them enough? Find out whether you’re investing enough time and effort in training people to move up within your company.</li>\n<li>Management Performance – your employees are only as good as their leaders. Learn what those that work for you think about their supervisor, whether that be you or another hired manager within the company.</li>\n<li>Work Environment – inclusiveness, diversity, and work culture play a role in how satisfied your employees are.</li>\n<li>Team Performance – find out how your employees feel the teams they’re on are performing and what areas can be improved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Knowing what categories to touch on in your employee surveys is just half the battle. Take a look at some specific questions to help you get your employee surveys forms started.</p>\n<p><strong>1. How Happy Are You at Work?</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to gauge employee satisfaction, and find out whether they’re happy working for you, ask them. This is a direct question that anyone can answer and gives you a serious look into company morale.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to set up a question like this is to use a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/sample-likert-scale-questions-for-wordpress-survey-forms/\">Likert Scale form field</a> on your employee survey form and have employees answer on a scale of 1 to 7 how happy they are working for you.</p>\n<p><strong>2. I Would Recommend My Company as a Great Place to Work<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Using a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-net-promoter-score-nps-survey-in-wordpress/\">Net Promoter Score (NPS) form field</a>, you can easily determine whether your employees would recommend your business as a great place to work or not.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-353188\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NPS-score-form-field.png\" alt=\"NPS score form field\" width=\"562\" height=\"128\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NPS-score-form-field.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NPS-score-form-field-300x68.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Though this employee survey question doesn’t give you the whole story, it’s a great starting place. After all, some people may be planning to leave your company soon, but might still recommend it to others.</p>\n<p>That said, a consistent NPS from employees shows you that you’re doing something right.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Do You Have a Clear Understanding of Your Path to Promotion?<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">study by Gallup</a> found that those that are given the opportunity to develop within a company are twice as likely to stay with a company.</p>\n<p>Make sure your employees understand what their growth opportunities are and what it takes to get promoted from within.</p>\n<p>If you find that people are unsure about how to grow alongside your business, begin offering more training sessions to develop employees’ skills and prevent them from finding work elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do You Have the Tools and Resources Needed to Perform Your Job Well?<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>You may not realize that your employees are not reaching their full potential because of a lack of resources or tools.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this is an easy fix that will show employees you care about their ability to do their job well. It will also improve your business too.</p>\n<p>You can ask a simple “Yes” or “No” multiple choice question on your employee satisfaction survey form.</p>\n<p>Then, using <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-clutter-free-forms-with-smart-logic/\">WPForms’ smart conditional logic</a>, display an additional form field for those that answer “No” to find out what tool and resources they’re lacking so you can look into providing them.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-353189\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/smart-conditional-logic.gif\" alt=\"smart conditional logic\" width=\"562\" height=\"329\" /></p>\n<p><strong>5. Do You Feel Valued at Work?</strong><br />\nOnly <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/2014-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report?__hstc=225544837.46be13fd049a18041d31cd4647810ece.1546496149381.1546496149381.1546747077173.2&amp;__hssc=225544837.1.1546747077173&amp;__hsfp=3208895436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">21% of employees</a> feel strongly valued at work.</p>\n<p>In addition, another <a href=\"https://www.octanner.com/content/dam/oc-tanner/documents/global-research/White_Paper_Performance_Accelerated.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">79% of people</a> claim that “lack of appreciation” is the reason for leaving an otherwise good job.</p>\n<p>The truth is, people will work harder for you if they feel valued, appreciated, and like they mean something to the company.</p>\n<p>You may think you are appreciating those that make your business a success, but your employees may have other feelings. Don’t let your employees leave because of your lack of appreciation.</p>\n<p>Adding to this, you might want to ask your employees how they feel their supervisors do when it comes to recognition. This can be done using a Dropdown or Multiple Choice form field to make answering simple on your employees.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-353187\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/manager-recognition-dropdown.png\" alt=\"manager recognition dropdown\" width=\"562\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/manager-recognition-dropdown.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/manager-recognition-dropdown-300x96.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Without enough recognition, morale and work engagement will begin to drop. You might even notice a loss in productivity.</p>\n<p>The old rule, critique once, recognize twice is always a good motto for you and your managers to follow. But first, find out just how your employees feel by asking them.</p>\n<p><strong>6. How Satisfied Are You with the Company’s Benefits Package?<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>This is best set up as a Likert Scale listing all the benefits you offer employees.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-353185\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/benefits-package-likert-scale.png\" alt=\"benefits package likert scale\" width=\"562\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/benefits-package-likert-scale.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/benefits-package-likert-scale-300x215.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>The benefits package you offer employees can be used to retain current employees and attract new ones to your company. Finding out where you might be missing a vital benefit is crucial to the success of your business since this plays into employee satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Do You Feel Your Supervisors Take Your Feedback Seriously?</strong><br />\nPart of growing with a company is feeling like you have a voice. No one wants to work for a company that doesn’t listen to their feedback or take their suggestions seriously.</p>\n<p>Find out how comfortable your employees are with speaking up when they have ideas or even concerns. Plus, find out whether they feel those in charge of making decisions value what they have to say.</p>\n<p>The more involved your employees feel, the more productive and successful your business will be in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Do You Feel You Understand Our Organization’s Values?</strong><br />\nIt’s not enough to have your company’s vision, mission, and cultural values laid out in a document for employees to read. The last thing you want is to find out that people are working for you without any real understanding of how they’re actually contributing to the company.</p>\n<p>Want to add another question that will shed light on how your employees feel about your company’s culture? Ask them to write three words that describe your organization’s culture. With these results you can find ways to improve your business’ culture to fit the needs of your employees.</p>\n<p>And there you have it! You now know some vital questions to ask on an employee satisfaction survey.</p>\n<p>Want to make sure your employees fill out your employee satisfaction survey?

Knowing how to connect with alumni after graduation is important because they are more likely to contribute if they feel strongly connected to their alma mater.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll share with you some of the best ways to connect with alumni after graduation.</p>\n<h3>Why Connect with Alumni?</h3>\n<p>Staying connected with those that graduate from your institution is important for maintaining long-term relationships with those that once helped your school thrive.</p>\n<p>Here are the top reasons you should work hard to connect with alumni after graduation day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Repeat Business:</strong> Graduates that donate once are more likely to donate again in the future. It’s easier to retain old customers than it is to acquire new ones.</li>\n<li><strong>Positive Word of Mouth:</strong> People love to talk about their past experiences and alumni are no different. Maintaining positive relationships with those that graduate, and offering them exclusive access to alumni services, means more positive referrals coming your way.</li>\n<li><strong>Recruitment Opportunities:</strong> There’s nothing better than using past graduates to convince those looking to start college to go to your school. If you stay in touch with graduates, you can ask them to be a part of the recruitment process.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Rankings:</strong> If you want your school to rank well in the country, you’re going to need glowing references from alumni. If you don’t stay in touch with graduates, how can you expect to get them to review your school and help your rankings?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, connecting with alumni is important to the success of your institution.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how you can start actively engaging with alumni and nurturing long-lasting relationships.</p>\n<h3>1. Publish an Online Alumni Magazine</h3>\n<p>Much like the <a href=\"https://harvardmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Harvard Magazine</a>, founded by alumni for alumni, your institution can publish an online magazine designed to keep alumni connected to each other and the university they once attended.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-349987\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-magazine.png\" alt=\"alumni magazine\" width=\"562\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-magazine.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-magazine-300x204.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here are some of the things you can include in your publication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work alumni are doing for the university and community</li>\n<li>Research being performed by alumni and current students</li>\n<li>Upcoming events, conferences, and talks alumni might be interested in attending</li>\n<li>Career-related advice and job listings to help alumni looking for inspiration or a job</li>\n<li>Ways to get involved with the school</li>\n<li>Touching essays penned by graduates</li>\n<li>Professor profiles and the work they’ve been doing</li>\n<li>How to donate, as well as a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-donation-form-popup-in-wordpress/\">donation form</a> so alumni can contribute right away</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best way to let your alumni know new content has been published or a new issue has been released is via email. That’s why having an email newsletter signup form on your organization’s official website is so important.</p>\n<p>WPForms has a newsletter signup form template that makes collecting alumni emails simple. All graduates have to do is enter their name and email and they’ll be added to your email list.</p>\n<p>WPForms integrates with the following <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing service providers</a> and makes adding a signup checkbox to them all easy to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-getresponse-signup-checkbox-to-your-contact-form/\">GetResponse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-an-aweber-signup-checkbox-to-your-contact-form/\">AWeber</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-constant-contact-signup-checkbox-to-a-wordpress-form/\">Constant Contact</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-mailchimp-signup-checkbox-to-your-contact-form/\">MailChimp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-drip-signup-form-in-wordpress-updated/\">Drip</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-campaign-monitor-subscribe-form-in-wordpress/\">Campaign Monitor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless alumni regularly come to your website looking for new content, they’ll never know you’ve published another magazine. This hurts your chances of staying connected to those that no longer attend your school.</p>\n<p>Want to collect content for your alumni magazine from graduates themselves? Learn how to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-allow-users-to-submit-blog-posts-on-your-wordpress-site/\">accept post submissions on your WordPress site</a> so you can start highlighting past students.</p>\n<h3>2. Host Events and Feature Alumni</h3>\n<p>Hosting events on campus is a great way to bring alumni back to their alma mater to reminisce about their college days and stay connected.</p>\n<p>Here are some event ideas that alumni can either attend or become actively involved in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sporting events</li>\n<li>Informational sessions about graduate school</li>\n<li>Speaking events highlighting industry professionals or involving alumni</li>\n<li>Job or career fairs that alumni can use to get a job or hire people for their own businesses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No matter which kind of event you want to organize, remember, alumni will be most engaged if you make it all about them.</p>\n<p>For example, sell merchandise like the shirts sold by <a href=\"https://www.unlvalumni.org/events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">UNLV</a> that are made specifically for alumni that can be worn to alumni specific events.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-349990\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-events.png\" alt=\"alumni events\" width=\"562\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-events.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-events-300x130.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Need a great way to register alumni for an upcoming event? Use any of WPForms’ registration form templates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conference Registration</li>\n<li>Fundraiser Registration</li>\n<li>High School Reunion Registration (customized for college)</li>\n<li>Online Event Registration</li>\n<li>Workshop Registration</li>\n<li>Webinar Registration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WPForms’s registration form templates are fully customizable to meet your needs. You can add or remove form fields as needed so you can register alumni for any type of event you’re hosting in their honor.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-349986\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-event-registration.png\" alt=\"alumni event registration\" width=\"562\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-event-registration.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-event-registration-300x265.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>For example, integrate your registration form with <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/paypal-standard-addon/\">PayPal</a> or <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/stripe-addon/\">Stripe</a> to collect payment for events, send out email notifications with more information about the event, allow alumni to choose which day they’s like to attend if it’s a multi-day event, and more.</p>\n<p>This is also a great opportunity to add more alumni to your email list if they agree to subscribe to your newsletter.</p>\n<h3>3. Let Alumni Voice Their Opinion</h3>\n<p>There are always going to be things about going to college that past graduates really liked and things they hated. Luckily, you can collect the opinions of your alumni and use whatever they have to say to improve current students’ experiences.</p>\n<p>Invite alumni to visit your website and take your online survey about their time as a student at your school. Or, encourage site visitors to set aside some time and answer your pressing questions.</p>\n<p>No matter how you convince people to voice their opinions, use a WordPress form builder with powerful survey features such as the ones seen in WPForms to collect the data you need to improve your institution and reputation.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-349988\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-survey.png\" alt=\"alumni survey\" width=\"562\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-survey.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alumni-survey-300x277.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>WPForms comes with a variety of survey form templates, features, and form fields so you can find out all the information you need from alumni:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsive design so graduates on mobile devices can fill out forms</li>\n<li>Multi-page forms for those times you need to ask a lot of questions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-likert-scale-to-your-wordpress-forms-step-by-step/\">Likert scale</a> form fields for measuring people’s experiences or opinions</li>\n<li>Poll form templates for asking simple, one-off questions</li>\n<li>Suggestion and feedback form templates for getting concrete ideas from alumni</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-easily-enable-conditional-logic-for-user-ratings-in-wordpress/\">Rating form fields with smart conditional logic</a> that can be used as social proof on your website</li>\n<li>Visual survey reports in the backend of your site that you can export</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-net-promoter-score-nps-survey-in-wordpress/\">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</a> form fields and survey templates to find out whether an alumni would recommend your institution to others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can add questions related to being a student and/or being an alumni to your survey forms.

That means your forms look beautiful on all devices.</p>\n<p>So, let’s dive into some tips for boosting conversion rates with truly mobile-friendly forms.</p>\n<h3>1. Choose the Right Input Types</h3>\n<p>You might already know that reducing the number of form fields can encourage more people to submit your form. The shorter the form, the easier it is for your visitors to fill it out.</p>\n<p>That said, sometimes reducing the number of form fields can result in poor lead quality. That’s because generating high-quality leads require gathering more than just name and email address.</p>\n<p>In fact, making sure the information your prospects submit on your forms is accurate is as equally important as driving more people to fill out your form.</p>\n<p>Validating your form fields is one of the easiest ways to ensure that the information on your forms is accurate.</p>\n<p>In other words, requiring your users to fill out every field, input data in the correct format, and confirm important form fields such as passwords on a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-user-registration-form-in-wordpress/\">user registration form</a> helps you get the most accurate information possible.</p>\n<p>Take for instance Iron Mountain. By validating their form fields, they <a href=\"https://blog.optimizely.com/2014/04/07/ab-test-improve-lead-quality-b2b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">improved their number of qualified leads by 140%.</a></p>\n<p>WPForms comes with tons of form fields to choose from. And, it just so happens that form fields like Email, Phone, Address, and Website / URL automatically validate the input.</p>\n<p>Additionally, input types like the <a title=\"How to Add a WordPress Form With Datepicker\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-wordpress-form-with-datepicker/\">datepicker</a> are optimized for mobile devices as well. This makes form submissions convenient on all devices, which can encourage your prospects to submit your form regardless of the devices they use.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-349708\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/datepicker-for-mobile.png\" alt=\"datepicker for mobile\" width=\"562\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/datepicker-for-mobile.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/datepicker-for-mobile-300x172.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>2. Set the Field Height At Least 38px</h3>\n<p>Did you know that the average adult’s finger pad size is 10mm wide, which is equivalent to 38px?</p>\n<p>This means if your form fields are less than 38px, it will be hard for most of your mobile visitors to tap on it, which can reduce the form’s conversion rate.</p>\n<p>WPForms users do not have to worry about this because the default height of WPForms’ buttons and fields is set to 38px.</p>\n<p>WPForms also allows you to easily create a form without having to touch a single line of code. However, if you want to customize the CSS of your form to match your site’s design, you can modify it by <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-css-to-your-wpforms/\">adding a custom CSS class to your forms</a>.</p>\n<h3>3. Set the Font Size of Labels At Least 16px</h3>\n<p>While 14px is a fairly standard font size for the web, we recommend you make your font at least 16px on your form’s field labels.</p>\n<p>First off, the larger font size will make your forms easier to read.</p>\n<p>In addition, iOS devices will zoom in when any text below 16px is tapped, which can be distracting to your mobile visitors when they’re trying to fill out your form.</p>\n<p>The default font size of WPForms labels is 16px.</p>\n<h3>4. Turn Your Layout into Single Column</h3>\n<p>In terms of mobile form conversions, a single column layout is far better than a multi-column layout with questions positioned side by side, according to <a href=\"https://www.cxpartners.co.uk/our-thinking/web_forms_design_guidelines_an_eyetracking_study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">eye tracking studies</a>.</p>\n<p>Visually cluttered and complicated forms can distract your visitors. But, since every website and its audience is unique, it&#8217;s better to test your conversions by split testing your forms with a single column and multi-column layout rather than blindly follow a study conducted on other sites.</p>\n<p>If you want to, you can easily create a multi-column form layout with WPForms. You can learn <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-multi-column-form-layouts-in-wpforms/\">how to create a multi-column form layout here</a>.</p>\n<p>However, tapping on a multi-column form can be hard on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>That’s why even if you decided to create a multi-column form for your website, it&#8217;s best to turn it into a single column layout for mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-display-fields-in-a-single-column-on-mobile/\">how to turn a multi-column form into a single column for mobile visitors</a>.</p>\n<h3>5. Consider a Mobile Popup Form</h3>\n<p>If your mobile site is difficult to navigate, and your forms are hard to see and fill out, people will abandon your site regardless of what you have to offer.</p>\n<p>Luckily, our sister plugin, <a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OptinMonster</a>, has plenty of mobile popup form designs that will make seeing and filling out your site’s mobile forms easy on site visitors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-349709\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mobile-popup-example-optinmonster.png\" alt=\"mobile popup example optinmonster\" width=\"562\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mobile-popup-example-optinmonster.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mobile-popup-example-optinmonster-300x172.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>For help with this, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-contact-form-popup-in-wordpress/\">creating a mobile-friendly contact form popup</a> in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>6. Avoid Captchas</h3>\n<p>We’ll be the first to admit that captcha form fields can help prevent spam form submissions. After all, WPForms has a Captcha form field that requires users to answer a question or solve a math problem in order to submit a form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-249926\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Final-Custom-Captcha-Form.png\" alt=\"Final Custom Captcha Form\" width=\"562\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Final-Custom-Captcha-Form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Final-Custom-Captcha-Form-300x295.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>That said, on mobile devices, captcha form fields can be extremely annoying and hard to fill out, especially if you use the kind that has floating letters that oftentimes appear very blurry.</p>\n<p>In fact, a study performed by video app animoto found that removing the captcha form field from their form resulted in a <a href=\"https://usabilla.com/blog/optimizing-forms-greater-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">33% increase in form conversions</a>.</p>\n<p>If you worry about spam form submissions, don’t when using WPForms. All forms come with built-in honeypot protection. And if you feel you really need a captcha solution, you can always enable Google invisible reCAPTCHA on your mobile forms to help with unwanted form submissions.</p>\n<p>For more information about preventing unwanted form submissions, check out this exhaustive guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-spam-free-wordpress-contact-forms-the-ultimate-guide/#Custom-Captcha\">creating spam-free WordPress forms</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking for more ways to boost mobile form conversions?

With WP Mail SMTP, you can fix delivery issues by authenticating emails through your Gmail or G Suite account &#8212; all while keeping your login credentials safe. </p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll show you how to set up WP Mail SMTP for sending WordPress emails with your Gmail or G Suite email address.</p>\n<h3>Why You’re Not Receiving Notifications</h3>\n<p>By default, WordPress uses the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/php/\" target=\"_blank\">PHP</a> mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact plugin like <a href=\"http://wpforms.com/\">WPForms</a>.  The most common reason for not getting emails is that your WordPress hosting server is not configured to use PHP mail function.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, anti-spam efforts by email providers can impact your emails as well. As part of their filtering process, many email providers will check whether your email originates from the same domain noted in the From Email. For example, if your email claims to be sent from your Gmail address but is actually sent from your website&#8217;s server (rather than Gmail&#8217;s server), your email may be sent to spam or not be delivered at all.</p>\n<p>You can fix this by using SMTP instead of the PHP mail function. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the industry standard for sending emails reliably.</p>\n<h3>Why Use the WP Mail SMTP Plugin?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit of using the WP Mail SMTP plugin is that it lets you send WordPress emails securely using your Gmail or G Suite account without requiring to enable less secure apps in your account.</p>\n<p>In addition, unlike many other SMTP options, you won’t need to enter your Gmail username and password in your WordPress dashboard where other site users can see them. By using this method, you&#8217;ll help to <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ultimate Guide to WordPress Security\">keep your WordPress site secure</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how to set up WP Mail SMTP for sending WordPress emails.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Install the WP Mail SMTP Plugin</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WP Mail SMTP</a> plugin. For step-by-step instructions, you can check out <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\">WPBeginner&#8217;s guide on how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>After installing and activating WP Mail SMTP, go to <strong>Settings » WP Mail SMTP</strong> to open the plugin settings page. </p>\n<p>At the top of this page, you&#8217;ll see the <strong>From Email</strong> and <strong>From Name</strong>. You can ignore these settings, because Google will automatically force these values to match the email account used in the next step.</p>\n<p>To start the setup process, you&#8217;ll need to scroll to the <strong>Mailer</strong> field and select the <strong>Google</strong> option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Select-Gmail-mailer.png\" alt=\"Select Gmail mailer\" width=\"562\" height=\"100\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-339300\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Select-Gmail-mailer.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Select-Gmail-mailer-300x53.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You can skip the <strong>Return Path</strong> checkbox, as Google does not allow this setting to be altered.</p>\n<p>Next, you should see a new Gmail section appear. Here, you&#8217;ll see fields for <strong>Client Secret</strong> and <strong>Client ID</strong>.</p>\n<p>To get the information for these fields, you&#8217;ll need to create a web application through your Google account. This doesn&#8217;t require any coding, and we&#8217;ll show you exactly what to do.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Create a Web Application</h3>\n<p>To create an application, you&#8217;ll first need to <a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail&#038;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sign into your Gmail account and access Gmail&#8217;s application registration</a>. Clicking that link should open this Google page in a new tab or window, and you&#8217;ll want to keep your site settings open (we&#8217;ll return to those later).</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve followed that link and logged into your Gmail account, you should see a form named &#8220;Register your application for Gmail API in Google API Console&#8221;. </p>\n<p>In the dropdown labeled <strong>Select a project where your application will be registered</strong>, leave the default option of <strong>Create a project</strong>. Then, go ahead and click the <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Create-a-project-for-Gmail-app-registration.png\" alt=\"Create a project for Gmail app registration\" width=\"463\" height=\"259\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-117667\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Create-a-project-for-Gmail-app-registration.png 463w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Create-a-project-for-Gmail-app-registration-300x168.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you should see a screen that says &#8220;The API is enabled&#8221;. To proceed to the setup page, click the <strong>Go to credentials</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Gmail-API-is-enabled.png\" alt=\"Gmail API is enabled\" width=\"365\" height=\"127\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-117669\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Gmail-API-is-enabled.png 365w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Gmail-API-is-enabled-300x104.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" /></p>\n<p>In the next page, you’ll be prompted to determine the credentials you need. Here are the fields on this page and the options you&#8217;ll need to select:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Which API are you using?</strong> Gmail API</li>\n<li><strong>Where will you be calling the API from?</strong> Web server (e.g. node.js, Tomcat)</li>\n<li><strong>What data will you be accessing?</strong> User data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve made these selections, click the <strong>What credentials do I need?</strong> button to go to the next step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project.png\" alt=\"Add credentials to Gmail app project\" width=\"423\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-117678\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project.png 423w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project-288x300.png 288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" /></p>\n<p>For this step, you&#8217;ll be creating an OAuth client ID. OAuth, or Open Authorization, is what will provide permission for your website to use your Gmail account to authenticate emails.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter anything you like or leave the default name. This is only for reference within your Google account.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>Authorized JavaScript origins</strong>, you&#8217;ll need to enter your site&#8217;s URL.</p>\n<p>Last, we need to fill out the <strong>Authorized redirect URIs</strong> field. To get the URI for your site, you&#8217;ll need to go back to the tab or window with your WordPress site. Still on the <strong>Settings &raquo; WP Mail SMTP</strong> page, you&#8217;ll need to look under the Gmail section for the field labeled <strong>Authorized redirect URI</strong>.</p>\n<p>The value in this field should be your site&#8217;s URL followed by some extra details. You&#8217;ll need to copy this value, which is easily done by clicking the button with the copy icon. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png\" alt=\"Use button to copy authorized redirect URI from WP Mail SMTP settings\" width=\"826\" height=\"168\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118143\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png 826w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-300x61.png 300w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-768x156.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px\" /></p>\n<p>After copying the URI, return to the Google APIs page and paste it into the field under <strong>Authorized redirect URIs</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Create-a-Google-OAuth-client-ID.png\" alt=\"Create a Google OAuth client ID\" width=\"460\" height=\"555\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-117752\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Create-a-Google-OAuth-client-ID.png 460w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Create-a-Google-OAuth-client-ID-249x300.png 249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you can click the <strong>Create client ID</strong> button.</p>\n<p>For the last step in the app creation process, you&#8217;ll need to set up the consent screen. This screen will never be seen by your users since you&#8217;re only granting permission for your own site to use the Gmail account you own.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll just need to check your email address and then enter a <strong>Product name shown to users</strong> (such as the title of your website).

Here are some of the possible error messages and how to resolve them.</p>\n<p><strong>401. That’s an error.<br />\nError: invalid_client</strong><br />\nThis error appears when the Client ID isn&#8217;t able to be read properly. To fix, try copying the Client ID in again and check that there&#8217;s no whitespace or extra text.</p>\n<p><strong>400. That’s an error.<br />\nError: invalid_request<br />\nMissing required parameter: client_id</strong><br />\nThis error will display when the Client ID field is empty or not able to be read properly. To fix, copy in the Client ID again and be careful to not add extra text or whitespace.</p>\n<p><strong>cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem</strong><br />\nThis message means that the server is missing a certificate that’s required for SMTP to work. To fix, you&#8217;ll need to contact your site&#8217;s hosting provider to ask them to install this certificate (most likely the cacert.pem certificate, though it&#8217;s best to ask your host to check).</p>\n<p><strong>“code”: 401,<br />\n“message”: “Login Required”</strong><br />\nIf you see this in the debug message, permission still needs to be granted to your use Google account. For instructions on how to fix this, please see <a href=\"#step-3\" title=\"Step 3: Grant Permissions and Send Test Email\">Step 3</a> of this tutorial. Also, be sure to check that the From Email in your SMTP settings matches the email used to setup the Google app.</p>\n<h6>What If I Want to Switch to A Different Email Later?</h6>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to change to a different Gmail/G Suite email address, you&#8217;ll need to repeat all tutorial steps above. This includes generating a new Client ID and Client Secret under this other email account.</p>\n<p>When you get to the Authorization step (under Step 3), save your settings and then click the <strong>Remove Connection</strong> button. This will remove the authorization for your original email account and allow you to repeat the authorization steps with the new email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP.png\" alt=\"Remove connection in WP Mail SMTP\" width=\"703\" height=\"124\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-223847\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP.png 703w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-300x53.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" /></p>\n<p>That’s it!

Accepting guest posts is a great way to expand your network, build your brand, and save time so you can focus on other tasks to grow your business.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to get more guest post submissions on your WordPress blog.</p>\n<h3>1. Publish a &#8220;Write for Us&#8221; Page</h3>\n<p>Looking for an easy way to invite guest authors to contribute to your blog? You’ll need to publish a &#8220;Write for Us&#8221; page on your site. Be sure to list it in the navigation menu so it easily grabs the attention of your visitors.</p>\n<p>If done right, this page will attract relevant guest writers to your blog and help you generate a constant flow of great content.</p>\n<p>Below are a few things you should keep in mind when creating the &#8220;Write for Us&#8221; page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get discovered</strong>: Guest authors who regularly contribute to various blogs often use Google to find guest posting opportunities. You&#8217;ll need to use <a title=\"Ultimate Guide to WordPress SEO\" href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO</a> to optimize the URL slug and the content of your &#8220;Write for Us&#8221; page to make sure that your page shows up in their searches.</li>\n<li><strong>Include detailed guest post guidelines</strong>: Tell your visitors what kind of articles you’re looking for. You may also want to include formatting and post submission guidelines on that page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Review Guest Post Proposals</h3>\n<p>Reading and reviewing poor quality articles will consume a lot of time and defeats the purpose of accepting guest post submissions.</p>\n<p>Before reviewing a guest post, it&#8217;s always better to ask the author to send a proposal. This way, you can ensure that only high-quality articles are reviewed so you can save time.</p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Write for Us&#8221; page, you can <a title=\"How to Create a Simple Contact Form in WordPress\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-contact-form-in-wordpress/\">create a contact form</a> and encourage your visitors to submit a guest post proposal.</p>\n<p>You can ask for details like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post headline</li>\n<li>A small description or outline about the post</li>\n<li>Author bio</li>\n<li>Links to previous published work</li>\n<li>The author’s website or portfolio</li>\n<li>Topics the author is interested in writing about for future guest posting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like the proposal, you can invite the author to submit a guest post on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44176\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/get-more-guest-post-submissions.jpg\" alt=\"Get more guest post submissions by requiring proposals first\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/get-more-guest-post-submissions.jpg 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/get-more-guest-post-submissions-300x145.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<h3>3. Create a Frontend Submission Form</h3>\n<p>Providing an author account to everyone who wants to write on your site could be a big mistake. You don’t want someone to have an account on your site so that they can write anything they want.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, not giving authors an account, and manually reviewing every post submission can be even more tedious.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there’s an easy way to automate the review process for guest post submissions.</p>\n<p>With WPForms’ <a title=\"Post Submissions Addon\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/post-submissions-addon/\">post submission addon</a>, you can allow your website visitors to submit guest blog posts <strong>without having to log into the admin area</strong> of your site.</p>\n<p>All you need to do is to create a frontend submission form using our post submission addon. You can also collect all the necessary information that you need such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post Title</li>\n<li>Post Content</li>\n<li>Featured Image</li>\n<li>Custom Fields (aka Post Meta)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When someone submits a guest post from your guest post submission form, it will be automatically added to your post editor and will be marked as pending.</p>\n<p>Then, all you need to do is to review the posts before they go live. This is especially easy if authors that have previously submitted guest posts on your website do so again. The quality of work is likely the same, so if you have published their work in the past, the review process becomes even simpler.</p>\n<p>For help with automating this process, read our guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-allow-users-to-submit-blog-posts-on-your-wordpress-site/\">how to allow users to submit blog posts</a>.</p>\n<p>After creating your guest post submissions form, embed it on a page that is blocked from search engine robots.</p>\n<p>This way, you can stop search engines from crawling and indexing this page in search results. Doing this also ensures that only those visitors whose proposal is accepted can see this page.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, read this tutorial on <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-hide-a-wordpress-page-from-google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to hide a WordPress page from Google</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Invite Guest Authors</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-346467\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/guest-posts.jpg\" alt=\"guest posts\" width=\"562\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/guest-posts.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/guest-posts-300x172.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Just because you accept guest posts for your website, doesn’t mean you’ll receive quality articles that add value to your blog.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to get high-quality content for your blog, make sure to promote it heavily so it grabs the attention of the right audience. You can also invite potential guest authors who regularly contribute to various blogs in your niche.</p>\n<p>Below are a couple of takeaways that might help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browse through popular blogs in your niche and create a list of people who regularly contribute to those blogs. Let them know that you’ve started accepting guest posts on your blog and invite them to contribute.</li>\n<li>Create a guest posting contest to gather quality guest post submissions. You can reward one guest author every month and even use the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-contest-entry-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/\">contest entry form template</a> to help you get started. This will likely boost guest post submissions, especially among those trying to build a portfolio and gain exposure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. Include an Author Bio</h3>\n<p>There are many established websites that accept guest posts from people but don’t give credit to their guest writers for their work. And while this may work for them, if you’re trying to get more guest post submissions, offering a byline might be something you’ll need to do to attract more writers.</p>\n<p>People guest post on other people’s blogs to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a portfolio, especially when just starting out</li>\n<li>Expose their brand to a broader audience base</li>\n<li>Network with like-minded professionals and create partnership opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don’t always have to let guest writers link to their websites within the blogs they submit to your website. But allowing them to have a short byline with links to their social media accounts or website is a nice gesture.</p>\n<p>And trust us, writers looking to get their name out there are going to write their best content for you if they know their name will be attached to it.</p>\n<h3>6. Take it One Step Further and Pay Your Writers</h3>\n<p>Running an online business is tough work, especially if you do it all by yourself. Unfortunately, because running a website can be so time-consuming, many website owners fail to keep up with publishing regular content on their website.</p>\n<p>This not only hurts your site’s SEO, but negatively affects the user experience too. After all, people come to your website because they feel you offer them something of value. Your blog is a huge source of value to all site visitors, whether they are a customer or not.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself not being able to keep up with a consistent publishing schedule, and have a rolodex of regular guest post writers that drive traffic to your site, encourage conversions, and help you rank well, consider paying them to continue writing for you.</p>\n<p>You can pay people per post they submit or even require their posts to exceed a specific traffic threshold. That way you know that the posts you’re paying for are not only adding value to your site visitors’ lives, but your life as well.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!

Whether you run an event planning business, host fundraisers for your nonprofit, or like to throw big birthday bashes for your closest friends, getting feedback about your events can help you make improvements for next time.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll show you step by step how to create an event feedback form in WordPress so you can ask all your attendees what they liked and what they want to see change at the next event.</p>\n<h3>Why Create an Event Feedback Form?</h3>\n<p>No matter what type of events you host, it’s important to find out how attendees feel when they’re over so that you can do better next time. This is especially true if you run an event planning business and want to grow.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the benefits a good event feedback form offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine whether expectations were met</li>\n<li>Find out what people thought went well, and what people felt went wrong</li>\n<li>Get suggestions that can make your next event more satisfying for attendees</li>\n<li>Find out if people would be willing to attend a similar event in the future, and if not, why</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might think after hosting what you feel is a successful event that everyone that attended feels the same way. But the truth is, people aren’t always going to love your events.</p>\n<p>By placing an event feedback form on your website, you may find that there are simple ways to fix those negative opinions and make your next event better than ever.</p>\n<p>So, let’s take a look at how to create an event feedback form in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create an Event Feedback Form</h3>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms plugin</a>. For more details, see this step by step guide on <a title=\"Step by step guide on How to Install a WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to install a plugin in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, you’ll need to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/\">Form Templates Pack addon</a>.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Addon</strong> and find the one labeled <strong>Form Templates Pack addon</strong>.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Install Addon</strong> and then <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-291194\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon.png\" alt=\"form templates pack addon\" width=\"562\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon-300x103.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you’ll need to create a new form.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Add New</strong>, and name your form. Then, scroll down to the section labeled <strong>Additional Templates</strong> and type “Event Feedback Form” into the search bar.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-345828\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/event-feedback-form-template.png\" alt=\"event feedback form template\" width=\"562\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/event-feedback-form-template.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/event-feedback-form-template-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>When the pre-built event feedback form template loads, most of the work is already done for you. In fact, you’ll find the fields in the form asking the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please rate your overall experience at our event</li>\n<li>Would you return again next year?</li>\n<li>What could we have improved?</li>\n<li>Do you have any additional feedback?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-345829\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/event-feedback-form.png\" alt=\"event feedback form\" width=\"562\" height=\"455\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/event-feedback-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/event-feedback-form-300x243.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You can add additional fields to your form by dragging them from the left hand panel to the right hand panel.</p>\n<p>Then, click on the field to make any changes. You can also click on a form field and drag it to rearrange the order on your event feedback form.</p>\n<p>For example, you might add some of these form fields to your event feedback form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/beginners-guide-what-is-a-likert-scale-and-how-to-use-it/\">Likert Scale</a>:</strong> gauge people’s opinions, feelings, or attitudes about the event you hosted or the event planning business you run.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-net-promoter-score-nps-survey-in-wordpress/\">Net Promoter Score</a>:</strong> if you run an event planning business or regularly host people’s parties, nonprofit fundraisers, or office galas, find out how loyal people are to your business.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-user-ratings-to-your-wordpress-forms-step-by-step/\">Rating</a>:</strong> Give attendees the chance to rate your party planning skills and the event itself by adding a rating form field to your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also use WPForms’ smart conditional logic to display additional form fields based on an attendee’s answer. For instance, if you receive a rating of 3 or lower, you might display another form field asking your site visitor to explain why.</p>\n<p>For help with setting up conditional logic on your WordPress forms, check out this article on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-clutter-free-forms-with-smart-logic/\">creating clutter-free forms here</a>.</p>\n<p>When your form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your Event Feedback Form’s Settings</h3>\n<p>There are several settings to configure when creating an event feedback form in WordPress. We’ll start with the general settings first.</p>\n<p>To start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can configure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Name.</strong> Rename your form if you want to.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Description.</strong> Give your form a description.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Button Text.</strong> Customize the submit button copy.</li>\n<li><strong>Spam Prevention.</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-a-spam-free-contact-form-without-captcha/\">Enable the anti-spam honeypot feature</a> to prevent fake feedback form submissions. This feature is automatically enabled on all WordPress forms. If you decide to use another form of spam prevention, you can unclick this option or use it in addition to things like Google’s invisible CAPTCHA.</li>\n<li><strong>GDPR Enhancements.</strong> You can disable the storing of entry information and user details, such as IP addresses and user agents, in an effort to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-gdpr-compliant-forms/\">comply with GDPR requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Event Feedback Form’s Notifications</h3>\n<p>Notifications are a great way to send an email whenever a person submits a feedback form on your WordPress website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, unless you disable this feature, whenever someone leaves feedback on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">use smart tags</a>, you can also send a notification to your attendee when they submit feedback, letting them know you received their form and will be in contact shortly. This assures site visitors their forms have gone through properly.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>And, if you want to send more than one email, read this article on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to create multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want to keep branding across your notification emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Your Event Feedback Form’s Confirmations</h3>\n<p>Form confirmations are messages that display to site visitors once they submit an event feedback form on your website. They let people know that their feedback has been received and offer you the chance to let them know the next steps.</p>\n<p>WPForms has three confirmation types to choose from:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong> This is the default confirmation type in WPForms. When a site visitor leaves feedback, a simple message confirmation will appear letting them know it was received. Look here for some <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/form-success-message-ideas-to-boost-customer-happiness/\">great success messages</a> to help boost customer happiness.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Page.</strong> This confirmation type will take site visitors to a specific web page on your site thanking them for filling out your feedback form. For help doing this, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-redirect-users-after-wordpress-form-submit/\">redirecting customers to a thank you page</a>. In addition, be sure to check out our article on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/4-thank-you-page-examples-to-boost-customer-loyalty/\">creating effective Thank You pages</a> for boosting customer loyalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to URL (Redirect).</strong> This option is used when you want to send site visitors to a different website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s see how to set up a simple form confirmation in WPForms so you can customize the message site visitors will see when they leave feedback about an event you hosted.</p>\n<p>To start, click on the <strong>Confirmation</strong> tab in the Form Editor under <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, select the type of confirmation type you’d like to create. For this example, we’ll select <strong>Message</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246854\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png\" alt=\"Confirmation Message\" width=\"562\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message-300x155.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, customize the confirmation message to your liking, and click <strong>Save</strong> when you’re done.</p>\n<p>For help with other confirmation types, see out documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-confirmation-wpforms/\">setting up form confirmations</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Enable Surveys and Polls Reporting</h3>\n<p>If you’ve added survey or poll questions to your event feedback form using form fields like the Likert Scale or Rating field, you’ll need to enable survey and/or poll reporting so you can see the results in one convenient location.</p>\n<p>You can collect and view survey results on the following form fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single Line Text</li>\n<li>Paragraph Text</li>\n<li>Dropdown</li>\n<li>Checkboxes</li>\n<li>Multiple Choice</li>\n<li>Rating</li>\n<li>Likert Scale</li>\n<li>Net promoter Score</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Survey results are only seen by you in the backend of your website.</p>\n<p>You can collect and view poll results on the following form fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropdown</li>\n<li>Checkboxes</li>\n<li>Multiple Choice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Poll results are seen by you on the backend of your website <strong>and by site visitors</strong> on the frontend of your website.</p>\n<p>To enable survey and/or poll reporting, go to <strong>Surveys and Polls</strong> tab in the Form Editor under <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, click <strong>Enable Survey Reporting</strong> and/or <strong>Enable Poll Results</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-345832\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveys-and-polls-settings.png\" alt=\"surveys and polls settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveys-and-polls-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/surveys-and-polls-settings-300x128.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now, anytime someone submits feedback about an event you recently hosted using your event feedback form, you can access the results by clicking on <strong>Survey Results</strong> in the <strong>Forms Overview</strong> section.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-345831\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/survey-results.png\" alt=\"survey results\" width=\"562\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/survey-results.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/survey-results-300x123.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here is an example of what your results might look like:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-345830\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/example-survey-results.png\" alt=\"example survey results\" width=\"562\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/example-survey-results.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/example-survey-results-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 6: Add Your Event Feedback Form to Your Website</h3>\n<p>After you’ve created your event feedback form, you need to add it to your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>WPForms allows you to add your forms to many locations on your website, including your blog posts, pages, and even <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-contact-form-in-wordpress-sidebar-widget/\">sidebar widgets</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the most common post/page embed option.</p>\n<p>To start, create a new post or page in WordPress and then click on the <strong>Add Form</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Next, select your contact form in the modal popup and click <strong>Add Form</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-345827\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/add-event-feedback-form.png\" alt=\"add event feedback form\" width=\"562\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/add-event-feedback-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/add-event-feedback-form-300x181.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, publish your post or page so your event feedback form will appear on your website.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!
